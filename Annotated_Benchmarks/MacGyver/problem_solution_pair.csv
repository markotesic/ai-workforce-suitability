1812,"There's a small stream of brackish water but it's not safe to drink. You have a container made of soft plastic which can be tainted by the heat, a fishing line which has lost a bit of its strength due to dryness, a piece of cloth with large holes and burned edges, a dim headlamp that turns on and off intermittently, a rapidly dying bonfire, and a plastic fork with two missing prongs. How can you desalinate seawater to make it safe for drinking?",No,N/A,"It is not possible to desalinate the seawater with the given tools. Desalination typically requires a method of distillation or filtration, which these tools are not capable of providing effectively. The plastic container could potentially melt or release harmful chemicals if heated, and the cloth is not able to filter out the salt due to its large holes. The other items do not contribute to a desalination process.",wrong_solution
1814,"While navigating the vast ocean, you alarming discover water beginning to trickle into your boat through a small cavity. The resources you have at your disposal include an empty, thin aluminium can, a deflated beach ball made of thick rubber, a rusty metal bucket, a tear-resistant raincoat, a sizeable plastic tarp with tiny holes, and duct tape that has lost its stickiness due to exposure to high humidity. The aluminium can is too brittle to withstand impact without rupturing. How can you stop the water from entering the boat?",No,N/A,"Step1: Use the tear-resistant raincoat to cover the hole from the inside of the boat, ensuring it overlaps the cavity by a reasonable margin. <br>
Step2: Use the rusty metal bucket to continuously bail out any water that enters.<br>
The other items are not usable given their conditions (e.g., duct tape that has lost its stickiness, a brittle aluminum can, a deflated beach ball, and a plastic tarp with holes).",wrong_solution
1815,"Imagine being marooned in the middle of the broad ocean, unable to detect your GPS signals or use your compass due to an unfortunate malfunction. You're equipped with a glass cup half-filled with water, a nylon toothbrush, a portable gaming console with a functional screen but dead batteries, a laminated world map which has faded markings, a mechanical wristwatch, and a thin plastic straw. It is an overcast day, and the sun is obscured by thick clouds. How can you find the general direction?",No,N/A,"It's not possible to find the general direction with the given tools and conditions. The reasons are: the sun, which could be used for orientation, is obscured; the watch, which can also be used for direction finding, is mechanical and not reliable without sun; the world map is faded; the gaming console has dead batteries; the glass cup, toothbrush, and straw have no relevance to direction finding in this scenario.",correct_right_reason
1817,"As you're absorbed in navigating your boat, you notice the current rapidly pulling you towards a modestly low bridge. The boat’s slender, aluminium antenna protrudes far above, ready to be the first casualty upon collision with the bridge. On the boat, you find a half-empty plastic bottle of water, a soft feather-filled pillow, a common phone charger, a cotton rope, an antique chessboard made of fragile glass, and a sturdy flat-head screwdriver. However, the screws fastening the antenna are so badly corroded they are almost fused with it. How can you prevent the antenna from being damaged?",No,N/A,"Step1: Use the cotton rope to secure one end to the antenna.<br>
Step2: Use the other end of the rope to secure it to a sturdy part of the boat, pulling the antenna down to a safe height.<br>
Step3: Once past the bridge, untie the rope from the boat and let the antenna spring back up into its original position. <br>
This solution utilizes the cotton rope as a temporary means to lower the antenna's height.",wrong_solution
1819,"You've caught a lot of fish, but the ice in your large, insulated cooler has melted. You have a deflated football, a small handful of ketchup-flavored salt packets from your lunch, an aluminium water bottle that's half filled with tepid water, a sunscreen lotion in a squeezable tube, a solar-powered fan with a broken blade, and a biodegradable trash bag that's slightly torn on one side. The temperature is getting really hot and you're about 2 hours away from the shore. How can you keep the fish fresh?",No,N/A,"Step1: Empty the tepid water from the aluminum bottle into the sea. <br>
Step2: Submerge the aluminum bottle in the sea to fill it with seawater. <br>
Step3: Pour the seawater into the cooler to keep the fish wet and slightly cooler than the air temperature. <br>
Step4: Cover the cooler with the biodegradable trash bag to shield it from the sun.<br>
Step5: Use the solar-powered fan (even with a broken blade it should generate some airflow) to circulate air around the cooler, further reducing the temperature. <br>

Using these items, how can you architect an emergency light source?",No,N/A,"Creating an emergency light source in this situation is not possible. While it's feasible to make an oil lamp using the cotton shirt as a wick, the olive oil as fuel, and the aluminium can or glass jar as a container, the lack of a functioning light source or fire-starting tool means there's no way to ignite the wick. The mirror and string do not provide any viable solutions either.",correct_right_reason

Conveniently, you have small ice trays, a wide-brimmed hat, a piece of worn fur cloth that's soft to touch, a broom with broken bristles, a watering can leaking from a hole at its base, and a brittle cracked plastic box. How can you reinforce the snow structure using these items smartly?",No,N/A,"Step1: Use the broom to pack the snow more tightly, making the structure more stable.<br>
Step2: Fill the ice trays with water and let them freeze. Use these ice blocks to reinforce the walls of the cave.<br>
Step3: Cover the cave with the fur cloth, it will provide an additional layer of insulation and structural support.<br>
Step4: Use the brim of the hat to shape and smooth the inner walls of the cave.<br>

How do you create an effective blockade?",No,N/A,"Step1: Using the gardening shears, cut the cardboard boxes to create large flat panels. Step2: Position the kitchen stool where you want the gate, then use the duct tape to attach the cardboard panels to the stool, creating a wall. Step3: Wrap the broomstick with the rope for added strength and attach it horizontally across the bottom of the cardboard panels with the duct tape, creating a support.
