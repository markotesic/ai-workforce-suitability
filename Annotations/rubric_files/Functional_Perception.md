# **Functional Perception**

This rubric assesses how much a task relies on recognising function, that is understanding what roles objects, people, or pieces of information can play in achieving a goal. Difficulty climbs from tasks that require no functional reasoning, through obvious one-to-one matches, to challenges that demand spotting subtle or novel uses amid multiple, interacting constraints.

## **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without considering how anything might be used; rote recall, copying, or direct lookup is sufficient. Ignoring functional properties does not harm performance.

**Examples**:

* Copy a block of code exactly as shown.  
* List the seven continents.  
* Alphabetise a list of 50 surnames in strict ascending order, preserving each name’s original capitalisation and spacing.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Success requires spotting a single, obvious function an object or a person serves that most people recognise instantly. The mapping is one-to-one and literal with no competing options.

**Examples**:

* From {scissors, spoon, pencil}, choose the item best suited to cut paper.  
* Identify which profession (doctor, chef, lawyer) can diagnose an illness.  
* Select the file type that can store a photo: PNG, MP3, or TXT.

## **Level 2: Low**

The solver must choose correctly among a few alternatives by matching a basic property to a goal (e.g., strength, heat-resistance). A modest amount of inference or prior knowledge is helpful, but the rule stays concrete.

**Examples**:

* Given a shelf rated for 20kg and a 25kg box, decide if the shelf is an appropriate support and justify it in one sentence.  
* Pick the best container to transport hot soup: plastic grocery bag, paper coffee cup, or insulated thermos and explain why.  
* From these formats {Google Doc, PDF, and JPG}, pick the one you would use to share a 20-page research report draft with colleagues for collaborative editing, and state why.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Tasks require integrating multiple functional attributes or contextual constraints and ruling out options that are not fit-for-purpose. Accurate mapping of roles demands careful consideration of how each attribute interacts within the given context.

**Examples**:

* You must hang a 15 kg mirror on drywall: choose the correct fastener system from four options and explain how each component (stud, toggle bolt, adhesive) contributes.  
* A startup needs legal advice on IP, tax, and HR; assign the right type of lawyer to each issue from a mixed candidate list, giving one-sentence rationales.  
* From eight kitchen tools, select the three that let you zest a lemon, whip cream and measure 5 ml salt, making sure none has an overlapping function.

## **Level 4: High**

The solver must evaluate multiple interacting goals and constraints (cost, safety, time, availability) and map them onto a set of resources whose functions partly overlap or must be adapted in non-obvious ways. Success often requires recognising unconventional affordances and reasoning about trade-offs simultaneously.

**Examples**:

* Given terrain, weather, and casualty conditions, decide whether to deliver medical supplies by drone, helicopter, or ground team — and propose an unconventional adaptation (e.g., repurposing a drone battery pack to power field equipment).  
* Plan an improvised cooking session with limited tools: bake a pie crust without a rolling pin by identifying substitute objects (wine bottle, thermos) and explain trade-offs (ease of use, hygiene).  
* From a pool of ten staff profiles, assemble a project team that covers required skills while also spotting hidden affordances (e.g., a backend engineer with prior UX experience who can flexibly cover both roles under load).

## **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks demand recognising and combining non-obvious or novel functions and affordances across many elements under high uncertainty, often inventing unconventional uses while balancing competing constraints. Success requires synthesising affordances from diverse domains (technology, labour, materials, information) to generate creative, large-scale solutions that go beyond conventional repurposing, often amounting to flexible problem solving and innovation under pressure.

**Examples**:

* Devise how surplus shipping containers could be converted into a 50-bed modular clinic, not only repurposing structural features (corrugation strength, corner castings) but also inventing new ways to integrate plumbing, electrical, and ventilation systems into the container architecture.  
* In a disaster-response scenario with damaged infrastructure, design an ad-hoc communication network by combining affordances of personal smartphones, delivery trucks and retail Wi-Fi routers, balancing bandwidth and power limits to achieve reliable coverage.  
* Faced with a sudden global food-supply disruption, invent a multi-layered logistics solution that draws on drones, blockchain verification, existing cold-chain storage, and volunteer labour pools, showing how their heterogeneous functions can be recombined into a coherent, scalable distribution system.
