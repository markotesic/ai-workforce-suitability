# **Semantic Memory**

This rubric assesses how much a task requires learning information or “knowledge”. This may include “general” or “specialist” knowledge, information about word meanings or cultural norms, or  “scripts” as the standard or usual protocol for actions or activities. These tasks do not require memory for any specific episode, event or experience, but instead a general understanding and knowledge about “facts” or information that would be held in common or agreed upon by multiple individuals

## **Level 0: None**

No information about the world or how things work needed to solve the task. 

**Examples:**

* Learning, through trial and error, which action is rewarded.  
* Repeating back an action or word just experienced.  
* Identifying that two objects are different, but not being required to identify what those objects are or any other information about them.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level require extremely basic simple knowledge that is gleaned via extensive training/learning/exposure. For example, information that will be repeated throughout the vast majority of the internet, is very simple in structure and requires no inference.

**Examples:**

* Knowing the meaning and correct use of the most frequent words (for example, all the words in books aimed at 4-6 year old children)  
* Being able to identify the correct actions to perform in very common scenarios, such as how to open a word document, how to search for something simple online, how to wash a plate.  
* Knowing major and (almost) universal traditions, rules and taboos of human culture (e.g. that it is wrong to kill/steal, that people like gifts, that adults are in charge of children)

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively simple, common and straightforward information.  This may include detailed information about common things or somewhat specialist knowledge, but it doesn’t require expertise. This level can also be achieved through establishment of very simple knowledge after only a small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples:**

* Being able to identify multiple different common breeds of dog (e.g. alsatian, poodle, spaniel, labrador).   
* Knowing most standard traditions, rules and taboos in one’s own/the most familiar culture (e.g. that it is rude not to say “thank you”, that children can’t drive, that red traffic lights mean stop).  
* Incorporating very simple new information into knowledge base following only a brief exposure \- for example, learning the name of a new type of animal after being shown 5 examples.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively complex information. This may include detailed information, some specialist knowledge or dynamic/nuanced systems or dependencies. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively simple knowledge after only a small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples:**

* Being able to identify and differentiate multiple different types of tree (e.g. sycamore, oak, maple, cherry, horse chestnut, ash, birch, beech).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of all except the most uncommon words (for example, all the words in books aimed at adults).  
* Understanding nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ across 2-3 different cultures (e.g. that in the UK you generally tip following waiter service in a restaurant but not following buying a drink at a bar, but in the US you would tip in both situations; or that in Ireland it is polite to appear to refuse an offer or gift before accepting it, while in Germany the same behaviour may be taken as a genuine rejection).

## **Level 4: High**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of complex information. This may include very detailed information, specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This may also include knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on a large amount of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively complex knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples:**

* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of subtly different types of longhaired cat (e.g. Norwegian forest cat, Siberian forest cat, Maine coon, Ragdoll, Persian)  
* Understanding highly nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ across multiple different cultures, social groups and generations (e.g. In the UK, “its fine” may mean a large number of different things, varying considerably in valence (from “its amazing” to “its terrible”), implying varying social implications (the person is reassuring you / the person is furious with you) depending on the specific tone and context in which it is said).  
* Knowing how to use all standard types of software, application or platform.

## **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of highly complex information. This may include extremely detailed information, highly specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This includes knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on the limited quantity of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of highly complex knowledge after only minimal training or exposure.

**Examples:**

* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of extremely subtly different types of bird song (for eg being able to tell the species, sex, age and region of origin of the bird producing any given snippet of bird song).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of the vast majority of words across many languages.  
* Incorporating very complex new information into the knowledge base following only a brief exposure. For example, learning the workings of a combustion engine from reading a textbook once.
