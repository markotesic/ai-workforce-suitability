# Executive Function (EF)

**Executive function refers to a set of cognitive processes responsible for controlling and coordinating other mental resources to perform complex tasks.** It includes the ability to monitor and update relevant information as it becomes available (working memory), suppress distracting stimuli, thoughts, or actions that interfere with goal-directed behavior (inhibitory control), and adapt by shifting between mental sets, strategies, or goals in response to changing contexts or information (cognitive flexibility).

## Working Memory (EFWM)

## Inhibitory Control (EFIC)

## **Level 0: None**

The task does not require the suppression of competing goals or distracting stimuli. Can be completed via reflexive or automatic behaviours. 

**Examples**:

* Reflexively removing your hand from a hot stove.  
* Automatically turning toward a salient stimulus such as a flashing light.  
* Involuntary recall of a memory when cued.

## **Level 1: Very low**

The task is simple and familiar, with no external distractions competing for attention. However, it still requires attention, including the suppression of internally generated thoughts or actions that could interfere with task completion.

**Examples:**

* Typing your name on a keyboard.  
* Taking a sip of water.  
* Reading words that appear on a screen.

## **Level 2: Low** 

The task remains relatively simple and familiar but includes mild, potentially distracting stimuli. Successful performance requires sustained focus on the task, despite the presence of minor external distractions or competing goals.

**Examples:**

* Ignoring low levels of background noise while writing an email.  
* Walking past a snack when you're not hungry.  
* Driving a familiar route while listening to music.

**Level 3: Moderate.** This level involves resisting moderate interference from distracting stimuli or competing goals. While these situations are manageable, they require deliberate inhibitory control and sustained focus to stay on task.

Examples:

* You are about to accelerate as the traffic light turns green, but a pedestrian unexpectedly stepping into the road requires you to hit the brake pedal instead.  
* Ignoring your phone vibrating with a notification whilst concentrating on a lecture.  
* Choosing the less intuitive but correct answer on a test despite a misleading cue.

**Level 4: High.** This level involves complex tasks that require the effortful inhibition of prepotent responses. Distracting stimuli or competing goals can be salient, demanding sustained cognitive control to remain focused.

Examples:

* Refraining from making an emotionally charged comment during an argument.  
* Suppressing the urge to share a secret you’re excited to reveal.  
* Solving a multi-step problem in a busy, noisy, or chaotic environment.

**Level 5: Very high.** Tasks at this level require the suppression of multiple, highly salient impulses, affective responses, or external distractors over an extended duration. Effective performance requires sustained attentional control and effortful self-regulation.

Examples:

* A recovering addict resisting relapse despite exposure to personal triggers, social pressure and emotional distress.  
* Military personnel follow combat orders while managing fear and conflicting moral impulses in a chaotic environment.  
* An elite athlete executing a demanding routine in front of a critical audience, while ignoring pain, distraction, and self-doubt.

## Cognitive Flexibility (EFCF)

**Level 0: None**. Tasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.

Examples:

* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  
* Reciting a well-rehearsed poem or fact.  
* Repeatedly pressing a button on a keyboard in response to the same stimulus.

**Level 1: Very low**. The task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.

Examples:

* A student completing a series of maths problems, first addition then subtraction with the change clearly indicated on the worksheet.  
* When driving, the traffic light ahead turns red, prompting you to stop the car.  
* You are talking in the kitchen and an alarm on the oven reminds you to check if the turkey is cooked.

**Level 2: Low**. Tasks at this level require multiple shifts triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.

Examples:

* A visual search task where the target changes from red squares to blue squares based on the colour of the screen border.  
* Adjusting your pattern of walking to step around puddles as they appear on the path.  
* Switching from flat-head to phillips-head screwdriver when encountering screws with different heads.

**Level 3: Moderate**. Tasks at this level require individuals to shift between more complex tasks or strategies. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.

Examples:

* Changing strategies in a card game if your opponent is winning.  
* Cooking a meal with multiple components, requiring you to shift between tasks like chopping vegetables, stirring a sauce, and checking the oven at the right times.  
* During a debate, adapting your argument when presented with a counterpoint that challenges your original reasoning.

**Level 4: High**. Tasks at this level require individuals to engage in frequent, self-directed shifts between competing rules, goals, or strategies. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, prioritization, and flexible adaptation to changing task demands.

Examples:

* During a group project you shift between researching, writing, or coordinating with others based on how the project is progressing, and without explicit direction.  
* While teaching a class, you adapt your teaching methods  (e.g., switching between group work, one-on-one support, or direct instruction) depending on how students are engaging and responding.  
* Playing a strategy board game requires individuals to switch between different game mechanics (gathering resources, deploying game pieces, monitoring other players)  to prioritise the chance of success. 

**Level 5: Very High**. Tasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often competing, task demands under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Shifts in strategy or behavior might require the integration of multiple sources of information across different time scales.

Examples:

* Coordinating an emergency response during a natural disaster requires prioritizing actions based on incomplete information in evolving circumstances, all under significant time pressure.  
* In a hospital emergency department during a mass casualty event, a doctor must rapidly switch between treating patients with varying needs, coordinating with healthcare staff, and communicating with families. They will need to prioritise care based on the severity of patient needs and the availability of resources, all within a chaotic, high-pressure environment.  
* Managing a busy restaurant floor as a head waiter requires rapidly shifting attention between taking orders, coordinating with kitchen staff, addressing customer requests, and handling unexpected issues (like reservations or complaints). They will need to flexibly shift between tasks in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
