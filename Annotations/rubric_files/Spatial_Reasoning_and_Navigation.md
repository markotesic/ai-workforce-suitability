# **Spatial Reasoning and Navigation**

This rubric assesses the ability to understand, represent, and manipulate spatial relationships between objects or locations, and to use this knowledge for reasoning or navigation. Difficulty ranges from recognising simple static arrangements to mentally transforming shapes, tracking multiple objects in space, or planning efficient routes through complex environments. Tasks at higher levels often require integration across dimensions, updating one’s position relative to landmarks, or coordinating multiple frames of reference. In general, tasks may involve mental manipulation of spatial representations (e.g. rotation, translation, scaling), but they do not require simulating how objects or systems change dynamically over time.

## **Level 0: None** 

Tasks at this level do not require any spatial reasoning or navigation. They can be solved without representing, visualising, or manipulating spatial relationships.

**Examples**:

* Copy text from one document to another without regard to layout.  
* Transcribe the sentence “The book is on the table” from audio, without interpreting the spatial relation.  
* Recite a memorised sequence of numbers with no spatial component.

## **Level 1: Very Low** 

Tasks at this level involve recognising simple, static spatial relationships without any need for mental manipulation. Objects and their relationships are visible and unchanging.

**Examples**:

* Identify which of several shapes exactly matches a target shape shown in the same orientation.  
* Given two cubes of different dimensions shown side by side, determine which is larger.  
* Follow a one-step direction on a simple floor plan (e.g., “Point to the door at the end of the hallway”).

## **Level 2: Low** 

Tasks at this level require simple spatial manipulations or short navigation sequences. Transformations involve one or two objects and are straightforward (e.g., single rotations, translations, or direct comparisons). Navigation tasks may involve following a short path with clear instructions.

**Examples**:

* Decide whether a rectangular box will fit through a doorway when rotated once, based on simple visual comparison.   
* Identify which of three shapes matches a given figure rotated 90° clockwise.  
* Starting at the Altar, take three steps in sequence: north, north, then up. Where do you end up?

## **Level 3: Intermediate** 

Tasks at this level involve coordinating multiple spatial relationships or following multi-step navigation sequences. Success may require reasoning about several transformations in 2D or 3D space, handling multiple reference points, keeping track of where one object (or oneself) moves relative to others, or following a set of directions through a series of steps.

**Examples**:

* Compare two diagrams of a furnished room and identify which three objects have changed location.   
* Watch a video of a ball in mid-air; the video pauses before it lands. Predict where it will land, given the visible trajectory so far..  
* Follow a sequence of spatial directions (“Walk past the bridge, turn right after the post office, then take the second left”) and draw the path taken on a map.

## **Level 4: High** 

Tasks at this level require reasoning about complex spatial arrangements involving multiple objects, landmarks, or frames of reference. Success depends on integrating relations across the whole scene or environment, maintaining consistency across perspectives, and planning efficient routes through maps with multiple constraints.

**Examples**:

* Given a detailed description of a room layout (“The safe is hidden behind the painting to the right of the door. Opposite the painting is a window, and next to the window is a desk”), answer questions about relative positions such as “Where is the safe in relation to the desk?”  
* From a passage describing a football game where several players move relative to one another, track the changing positions and summarise their final arrangement on the field.  
* Plan the shortest route across a city map with five landmarks and multiple intersections, avoiding a closed road and minimising total distance.

## **Level 5: Very High** 

Tasks at this level require very advanced spatial reasoning, involving many simultaneous transformations, multiple perspectives, or highly complex environments. Success often depends on maintaining a consistent representation of intricate 3D structures or large-scale maps, updating across frames of reference, and coordinating dozens of spatial relations or navigation steps under uncertainty.

**Examples**:

* Interpret the 3D assembly instructions for a highly complex mechanical device (e.g., a jet engine component), visualising how over 50 parts fit together, and identify one misaligned step in the sequence.  
* From a 3-page description of a palace interior, reconstruct the entire floor plan with rooms, staircases, and hidden passages, and then answer queries about indirect spatial relations (e.g., “Which staircase connects the gallery and the throne room via the shortest path?”).  
* Given a 30-step text-adventure map with loops, dead ends, and multiple floors, plan a full traversal that starts at the Altar, reaches the Gallery while collecting three items, and exits at the Dome Room, without revisiting any location twice.
