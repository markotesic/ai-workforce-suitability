# **Theory of Mind**

This rubric assesses the extent to which a task requires reasoning about the mental states of other agents. At lower levels, tasks involve recognising that others may have knowledge, perceptions, or intentions different from one’s own. At higher levels, tasks require reasoning about false beliefs, nested beliefs (e.g., what one person thinks about another person’s belief), or how the interacting mental states of multiple agents shape behaviour and decision-making.

## **Level 0: None** 

The task does not require modelling the mental states of others. It may not involve other agents at all, or, if agents are present, their beliefs, knowledge, or intentions are irrelevant to completing the task.

**Examples:**

* Solving a Sudoku puzzle independently.  
* Operating a dishwasher according to its instruction manual.  
* Reading a book silently to yourself, even if others are present in the room.


## **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level require recognising a basic mental state such as a simple intention, perception, or feeling. The attribution is direct and obvious. No reasoning about hidden beliefs, uncertainty, or perspective-taking is required.

**Examples:**

* Recognizing that someone using a rock to crack open a coconut is trying to get to the food inside.  
* Identifying that someone's scrunched nose and turned head means they don't like the smell of spoiled milk.  
* Inferring that a child crying after dropping an ice cream cone is upset because they wanted to eat it.

## **Level 2: Low** 

Tasks at this level require attributing simple beliefs, desires, or intentions to others, going beyond direct state-behaviour associations. That is, it involves inferring specific mental properties about others (‘they *believe* the moon landing was a hoax’, ‘they *want* a glass of water’). Inference about mental states is present, but reasoning remains straightforward and does not involve false beliefs or recursive perspective-taking.

**Examples:**

* Telling a colleague about a mutual friend's new job, knowing they haven't heard the news yet and thus might be interested.  
* Finding a good hiding spot in hide-and-seek by visualizing where the seeker might look.  
* Recognizing that someone checking their watch repeatedly during a meeting probably wants to leave.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Tasks at this level require explicit reasoning about others’ mental states. This includes representing what someone believes, desires, or intends, even when it diverges from reality or from one’s own perspective and using this to explain or predict behaviour. Clear distinction between self and other representations is necessary.

**Examples:**

* Developing an intuitive theory about an agent’s future behaviour such as understanding that Sally will look for her marble in the basket where she left it, even though Anne moved it to the box when Sally was away.  
* Distinguishing between your own interpretation of a colleague’s argument and what the colleague actually intended to communicate, based on their prior statements and reasoning style.  
* Predicting that a friend will bring an umbrella because they believe it will rain, even though you know the forecast has changed and the rain has already passed.

## **Level 4: High** 

Tasks at this level require reasoning about the beliefs, desires, or intentions of multiple people at once. Success often depends on tracking how these mental states interact, sometimes in conflict, sometimes in coordination, and using them to understand group dynamics or predict outcomes. This goes beyond dyadic reasoning to multi-agent perspective-taking.

**Examples:**

* Understanding a dinner-party scenario in which Jane tells Steve that his girlfriend Abigail wants to leave, but Steve doubts her because he thinks Jane is jealous after seeing Abigail talk to Andrew. Correct interpretation requires representing each person’s belief and motivation.  
* Managing a work team where one employee misinterprets a colleague’s actions as deliberately unhelpful, and recognising how this false belief creates tension that affects the wider group.  
* Leading a negotiation among several stakeholders, each with different beliefs about others’ intentions and limits, while anticipating how these perspectives shape the dynamics of the discussion.

## **Level 5: Very High** 

Tasks at this level require reasoning about complex, dynamic networks of beliefs, desires, and intentions across multiple people, often recursively (e.g., “I think that she believes he suspects…”). Success depends on maintaining and updating nested perspectives, anticipating how misunderstandings or shifting beliefs ripple across a group and integrating these into long-term predictions or strategies.

**Examples:**

* Following the plot of a political thriller where Diplomat A leaks false information, intending Rival B to believe it. Rival B does indeed assume it is true. Meanwhile, Diplomat C recognises that A’s leak is a deliberate trap and reasons about both B’s mistaken belief and A’s deceptive intent. Correct interpretation requires tracking each agent’s beliefs about the others’ beliefs.  
* Mediating between two companies in a merger when Leadership Team A believes Team B wants quick profits, while Team B believes Team A is seeking long-term stability. Each team also holds competing models of how the other side perceives their own bargaining stance (e.g., “We think they believe we are bluffing”). Reasoning requires tracking nested and conflicting perspectives on both goals and meta-beliefs.  
* Anticipating the social fallout in a large online community where rumours spread about a moderator’s intentions, requiring reasoning about what different groups believe, what they believe others believe, and how those beliefs influence collective behaviour over time.
