# **Mental Simulation**

This rubric assesses how much a task requires mentally running a scenario forward or backward, envisioning how elements of the world, people, or abstract systems will change over time once certain actions or events occur. As difficulty increases, more variables interact, timelines lengthen, uncertainty grows, and the simulation may incorporate additional agents, constraints, or counterfactual branches.

## **Level 0: None**

A response can be produced purely by retrieving or recognising information; no imagining of future or alternative scenarios is needed.

**Examples:**

* What is the boiling point of water at sea level in °C?  
* Translate ‘Buenos días’ into English.  
* Which planet is third from the Sun?

## **Level 1: Very Low**

The task asks for an immediate consequence of one action on one object or person—an uncomplicated “if‑then” imagination. Typically only one variable changes, and intervening events are negligible.

**Examples:**

* What will probably happen to the tower of blocks if you remove the lowest block?  
* If you pour red dye into a glass of clear water, what colour will the water turn?  
* If you tell your manager that a colleague missed a deadline, what is the first thing the manager is likely to do next?

## **Level 2: Low**

The respondent must visualise a brief sequence (up to three linked effects) governed by simple, explicit rules and no branching. The mental simulation involves few moving parts.

**Examples:**

* Imagine you leave an open can of soda on the balcony in freezing weather overnight. Describe the state of the can and the soda the next morning, step by step.  
* A person on the ground floor presses the elevator’s ‘Up’ button in a four-storey office building when no one else is using the lift. Describe the sequence of indicator lights, chimes, and door movements from the moment the button is pressed until the person can step inside and the elevator begins ascending.  
* If you replace a desktop computer’s spinning‑disk drive with an SSD, list the next three noticeable changes a typical user will experience in order of appearance.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

A chain of five or more interactions must be envisioned, possibly from another agent’s viewpoint or with diverging outcomes. The simulation must stay internally consistent despite uncertainty.

**Examples:**

* Your team shares a confidential slide deck with a partner company under NDA. What are two plausible ways the information could leak over the next month, showing the intermediate hand‑offs and the final repercussion for your team?  
* Predict the indoor temperature and occupants’ next actions over eight winter hours if the thermostat battery dies at 02:00, two occupants wake intermittently, one opens a window at 04:00, and outside temperature drops 1 °C per hour; branch to two outcomes depending on whether the occupants locate spare batteries before 06:00.  
* In a small open‑source project, one contributor secretly rewrites the licensing header in a single file. Map out at least five subsequent project events (code reviews, issue discussions, legal notices) and branch to two possible licence‑compliance outcomes.

## **Level 4: High**

The respondent must construct a mental model spanning many steps, multiple interacting subsystems, and partial uncertainty. While the simulation does not need precise quantitative accuracy, it should integrate several evolving processes, track constraints over time, and produce a coherent best-guess projection.

**Examples:**

* Forecast the first 72 hours after a Category-3 hurricane strikes a coastal city. Without external modelling tools, outline a plausible hour-by-hour scenario that tracks power-grid failures, hospital capacity, supply-chain disruptions, and conflicting evacuation orders, explaining how these subsystems interact to shape emergency response and citizen mobility.  
* Simulate the carbon concentration in a closed terrarium for two weeks after introducing six crickets and one small spider, accounting for respiration, plant photosynthesis cycles, and a variable 12/12 light schedule.  
* Imagine an economy where a 10% transaction tax is introduced overnight. Predict the cascading effects on item prices, trading volume changes, and black‑market activity across the first five days.

## **Level 5: Very High** 

## An elaborate scenario must be constructed with adversarial or stochastic elements, and nested contingencies. The simulation includes at least two branching futures and variables that diverge across branches.

**Examples:**

* “Project the geopolitical, economic, and environmental outcomes over 10 years if the Arctic shipping route becomes ice‑free year‑round starting in 2030\. Consider at least five stakeholder blocs (US, Russia, China, EU, Indigenous communities) and detail three branching scenarios based on different international‑treaty responses.  
* Imagine a social‑media platform introduces a perfectly accurate deepfake voice‑generation tool available to all users. Simulate the evolution over two years of misinformation tactics, counter‑measures by fact‑checkers, user trust metrics, and advertising revenue under high, medium, and low regulatory‑oversight branches.  
* Run a counterfactual history in which the 2008 global financial crash was averted by early intervention in 2006\. Predict domino effects on housing markets, fintech innovation, and sovereign debt crises through 2020, giving at least three variables that differ significantly from actual history.
