# **Causal Reasoning**

This rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to identify, explain, reason about or manipulate cause‑and‑effect relationships**,** including counterfactual thinking about what would have happened under different circumstances. Difficulty rises with the number of interacting causes and effects, the network structure (chains, forks, colliders), the presence of hidden or probabilistic variables, and the need to reason about interventions rather than correlations.

## **Level 0: None**

The task needs no causal thinking: it only asks for a fact, definition, or observed correlation without explaining why or what‑if.

**Examples:**

* List the main exports of Brazil.  
* Translate ‘La teoría de la evolución’ into English.  
* The scatter‑plot shows income on the y‑axis and years of education on the x‑axis. Describe the pattern.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Requires spotting or predicting a single, obvious cause and effect link with no uncertainty or competing explanations.

**Examples:**

* The man scratched his head then flipped the switch on the wall. Immediately the light turned on. Was this caused by the man scratching his head or flipping the switch?  
* If you remove the bottom bowl from a neat stack of three bowls, what happens to the other two?  
* As the man was talking he knocked the glass. The glass fell off the table. Did the glass fall because he was talking or because it was knocked?

## **Level 2: Low**

Involves a two‑ or three‑step causal chain or choosing between a small set of mutually exclusive, well‑specified causes. Assumptions are deterministic and explicit.

**Examples:**

* A car battery was left connected to headlights overnight; in the morning the engine will not start. Explain how this could happen using 2 intermediary steps.  
* A potted plant wilts after five days: decide whether lack of water or lack of sunlight is the more plausible single cause, given daily weather reports.  
* Describe how (1) raising the room thermostat and (2) opening a window would each affect indoor temperature in sequence.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Reason about several interacting causes (3–5) under light uncertainty, possibly involving a collider or fork pattern. Must weigh likelihoods of causes and effects.

**Examples:**

* A restaurant’s monthly revenue dropped. Potential causes are (a) a nearby road closure, (b) poor online reviews, (c) a price increase, (d) a new competitor. Given last month’s traffic data and review scores, rank the two most probable causes and provide justification.  
* Patient shows fever, rash, and joint pain; consider dengue, measles, and lupus as causes. Explain which test result would let you rule out each disease and why.  
* A local barn is on fire. You know there was lightning last night. You also know that insulation in that barn is not great. Estimate the likelihood that the barn lit up because of each cause and also consider how likely is that the other cause happened given one of the causes also happened.

## **Level 4: High**

Work with environments that have many causes and effects (≥ 6) including unobserved confounders or feedback loops; reason about the effect of hypothetical interventions or explain observed paradoxes (e.g., Simpson’s). Causes and effects are probabilistic in nature.

**Examples:**

* A company introduces a performance-bonus scheme to increase productivity. Over the next year, some teams improve while others decline. Consider at least six factors, e.g. intrinsic motivation, extrinsic rewards, peer competition, stress, turnover, managerial support, and job satisfaction, and explain how they could interact to produce both positive and negative outcomes. Identify at least one feedback loop in the system.  
* Suppose the central bank bumps its policy rate up by exactly 1 percentage point at the start of Q1. Show how six factors—interest rate, inflation, unemployment, household spending, the dollar–euro exchange rate, and foreign investment—interact and explain what is likely to happen to each factor by the end of Q4. Point out at least two loops in the story (for example, expensive loans → less spending → lower inflation, or higher rates → stronger dollar → cheaper imports → lower inflation)  
* A national health audit shows Hospital A has a higher overall patient‑mortality rate than Hospital B, yet within every triage‑severity category (mild, moderate, severe, critical) Hospital A’s mortality is lower. Explain how this reversal can occur, draw a causal diagram that accounts for patient‑severity as a confounder, and outline the statistical adjustment needed to compare hospital quality fairly.

## **Level 5: Very High**

Compose or analyse large‑scale, multi‑layer causal situations (dozens of factors) with stochastic dynamics and interventions. Must articulate counterfactual worlds (“If X hadn’t occurred…”) and estimate downstream ripple effects over years.

**Examples:**

* Model the causal impact of a nationwide carbon tax introduced in 2026 on GDP, employment, energy mix, and health outcomes through 2036\. Provide two counterfactual scenarios (no tax; delayed tax) and identify which observable metrics would distinguish the realities by 2030\.  
* Outline how disclosure of ‘proof‑of‑alien‑life’ footage might cascade through social media, political institutions, financial markets, and religious organisations over five years. Include at least three mutually influencing feedback loops and suggest one intervention that could dampen mass panic.  
* Construct a causal decision diagram for AGI deployment that includes research races, safety investments, regulatory actions, and potential adversarial sabotage. Use the diagram to argue whether a unilateral deployment moratorium would reduce existential‑risk probability, citing key counterfactual pathways.
