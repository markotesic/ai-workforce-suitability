## **Episodic/Episodic-Like Memory** 

This rubric evaluates the ability to retrieve information about specific episodes or events that are no longer available to perception and have left temporary storage (i.e. happened more than 5 minutes ago, or are no longer in the context window).  

Within these tasks there are some specific terminologies: “Encoding” refers to the perception, experience or exposure to the to-be-remembered content \- that is, the direct experience that is the subject for later memory assessment. “Retention” and “Retention interval” refer to the period in between that first “encoding” exposure and the time that the information must be recalled. “Retrieval” or “Recall” refer to the process of indicating what is remembered: That might be choosing an item from a list, indicating that given content has, or has not, been seen before (also sometimes coded as “old” or “new” where “old” means that it has appeared as part of the task already, and “new” means that that this item is being seen for the first time in this task), or describing an experience or perception in the past without external cues. 

The information can be considered in terms of its content (“what” is remembered \- .e.g an item, an action, a person, a spatial location, a time of day), the structure of that information (e.g. are the content elements integrated together to form a single multifaceted event memory (of a THING that happened in a specific TIME and PLACE), the accessibility of the information (e.g. can the information be spontaneously produced, or must it be cued or prompted) and the malleability of the information (how is the information presented and used). Each of these elements is subject to its own levels of complexity and difficulty. 

The features that can vary to increase difficulty include:

* Number of to-be-remembered items  
* Set size / number of distractors (that is, how many possible answers are there to choose from \- often equated to the likelihood of getting the correct answer through guessing, though not always the same, depending on the nature of the task)  
* Precision required / Similarity of distractors (that is, how closely matched to the target item the alternative, but incorrect, options are, how much detail is required in the recall)  
* Length of time item must be remembered for (that is, how long is the item out of direct perception in between encoding and retrieval)  
* Amount/depth of original experience \- that is how long was it experienced for, how many times was the experience repeated, how in-depth was the experience (just passive viewing? Detailed interaction?)  
* Pro-active interference (tasks being completed immediately before encoding that might disrupt encoding either through residual divided attention, or through exposure to scenarios or stimuli that may in some way alter the encoding of the target stimulus)  
* Retro-active interference (tasks being completed during the retention interval that may distract from, displace, or otherwise confuse or interfere with the encoded information)  
* Degree to which the to-be-remembered information fits within a semantic, spatial, temporal or logical structure \- is the item familiar/namable, does the spatial context contain many reference points (e.g. unique landmarks), is the time with reference to a clock, are any associations to be formed between semantically linked items, are they within a broader structure (e.g. card within a deck)?   
* Cueing: Whether recall is “cued” \- i.e. it is necessary simply to pick a “seen before” item from provided options, complete a partial representation (for eg. provide a full word in response to a word stub such as “CON\_\_\_\_”, or identify an item from a degraded image), or “free” \- i.e. it is necessary to produce an account of the previous experience ‘spontaneously’ without cueing (e.g. “please tell me all the words on the list”): May include whether context of retrieval is similar to context of encoding (are there fundamental changes in the context, nature or presentation of task in between encoding and retrieval that may render previous information less accessible).

### **Level 0  None**

No memory for previous experience is required to solve the task, or the task can be solved using only general knowledge rather than memory of a specific event. 

**Examples**

* Learning, through trial and error, which action is rewarded.  
* Reading a word  
* Identifying features of an object that is currently within perception  
* ‘Knowing’ that the capital of France is Paris, but not being required to report when and how this information was learned  
* Solving a task using information that is within the context window, is currently in perception 

### **Level 1: Very Low**

The easiest tasks at this level require memory of extremely limited span, scope, precision, longevity or robustness. The hardest tasks at this level require item memory for a small number of items, locations or times over relatively short durations and/or with minimal interference or distraction and/or where a limited amount of precision or integration is required. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. 

**Examples**

* Being able to correctly recall a single word that has been out of perception/context window for \~5 minutes, during which no other tasks or stimuli have been experienced.  
* Being able to correctly recall 5 locations that were experienced \~30 seconds previously, during which an easy and unrelated activity (e.g. doing a simple maths problem) was conducted.  
* When looking through a series of 10 photos, at \~5 seconds per photo, being able to recognise that the series has returned to the beginning and the current image has been seen before and was the first in the series  
* Being faster/more able to identify a blurry image following a recent experience of the intact image, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   
* Being able to remember the location of 2-4 specific objects placed in novel and unique locations that are representable by binary associations (e.g. ball-box; cup-table). 

### **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require memory for a small-medium number of elements (e.g. items/locations/actions) over slightly longer periods (minutes to hours) and/or with a small amount of interference or distraction and/or where a moderate amount of precision, integration or flexibility is required. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. 

**Examples**

* Being able to correctly recall a list of 5 words that was experienced 5 minutes previously, during which an easy and unrelated activity (e.g. completing a jigsaw) was conducted  
* In a conversation, being able to notice that a person is repeating themselves when they tell the same story after 2 hours (during which other things have been discussed)  
* Being able to correctly identify each of 10 pictures seen 30 minutes ago from a line-up 9 similar items (e.g. identify a previously-seen picture of a black poodle from an array including a brown poodle, a golden poodle, a black labradoodle, a golden labradoodle, a brown labradoodle, a black cockapoo, a brown cockapoo, a golden cockapoo and a portuguese water dog)  
* Being able to recall a previously seen word when shown another word that was paired with it at the original presentation (for example, having studied “PANDA-CURTAIN”, and later being shown “PANDA- \_\_\_\_\_?”, being able to produce “Curtain”)  
* Being able to recall some details of a simple event (including where and when it happened) when prompted with the exact context and circumstances of the event in detail beforehand.  
* Being able to integrate information from previous experience with a specific item, space or context into current decision-making (for example “last time I saw this person they had just had a baby, so I should ask after their child” or “last time I was in this room the heating was broken, so I may need my coat”).  
* Being able to integrate information from previous experience with new incoming information about the same item, person or context to update the knowledge base (“this person just told me “she said yes\!” \- last time I saw them they told me “I’m going to ask out Emily”, so now I know that they are in a relationship with Emily” or “as I walked into the office, the heating technician told me “now it’s the opposite problem\!”, last time I was in this place the heating was broken and I was too cold, so it is likely that it is currently too hot”).  
* Being able to remember the locations of all four two of two paris of socks when one of each pair was hidden in different locations in one bedroom and one of each pair were hidden in different locations in a different bedroom (i.e. where “blue sock-bed” or “red sock-cupboard” would be insufficient, but information must contain item, location and room \- i.e. “master bedroom \- red sock \- cupboard, childs bedroom \- red sock \- bed”)

### **Level 3: Medium**

Tasks at this level require memory for a moderate number of items, for example over a period of hours to days (or a larger number for shorter periods), with a notable degree of distraction or interference and/or to a high degree of precision, integration or flexibility. A Combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. 

**Examples**

* Being able to correctly recall the locations where 20 balls were hidden 10 minutes previously, during which no other tasks or stimuli have been experienced  
* Being able to correctly recall a list of 7 words that was experienced briefly 10 minutes previously, during which a difficult task involving highly similar words was conducted.   
* Recalling a fact that someone told about themselves in passing a year ago, and using this to inform what gift to buy them  
* Being able to correctly identify each of 10 pictures seen 30 minutes ago each from a line-up 12 highly similar items (e.g. identify a previously-seen picture of a black poodle from an array including 8 other black poodles).  
* Being able to remember the location of multiple a specific objects based on where they were placed most recently, when they are often placed in different places (for example, where you put your keys, wallet and phone this morning, when they are all in different locations, each of which is different to were you put them yesterday, but where you put one today may be the same as where you put another yesterday).  
* Being able to spontaneously and accurately recall details of a specific complex event without any cueing.   
* Being able to infer the current state of the world by combining information from memory with information about the memory (for eg. how long ago the event happened), general knowledge and new information (“I put the milk in the fridge at home yesterday morning. I am currently away at a conference and have just learned from someone here that a powercut affecting our whole town occurred yesterday lunchtime. I therefore know that the fridge has been off. Given that milk takes 1 day to go bad and I wont be home until tomorrow morning, I should buy new milk on the way home as the milk in the fridge will be bad”).  

### **Level 4: High**

Tasks at this level require memory for a large number of elements, following only brief exposure, over long or very long periods (hours-years), robust against significant distraction and interference and/or requires very high levels of precision and/or with a significant degree of integration. A combination of more challenges (e.g. number of items, amount of integration, precision required, level of cueing) may bump a task up to a higher level. 

**Examples**

* Be able to spend a day watching every single person who walks through an airport terminal and then recognise any of them within a crowd of novel faces the next day.   
* Being able to quote a substantial piece of writing (such as a novella, long poem, or playscript) verbatim after a single reading.   
* Being able to correctly recall the location of 50 different items that were hidden around a large area the previous day, when multiple other activities have occurred in the interim.  
* Being able to watch a deck of cards dealt, then report on the exact order they were dealt in 4 hours later, during which time a game of poker has been played using the same deck.  
* Being able to remember everything a person has said and done, where and when they said and done it, over the past month to identify inconsistencies, repetitions, and behavioural change.  
* Being able to update a memory of a complex previous event in the context of new information and also update all knowledge updates that were made on the basis of that previous experience (for example, a week after analysing a 40-page accident report you learn that a key CCTV timestamp was off by two hours; you must revise the entire event timeline and rescind every earlier conclusion that relied on the erroneous timing)  
* Able to update knowledge base flexibly with information from previous experiences while also separately maintaining the unique features of each experience from which the knowledge was gleaned. 

### **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks at this level require memory for a very very large number of elements, following only brief exposure, indefinitely and with high precision and perfect association across with co-occurring elements, robust against any distraction and interference.

**Examples**

* Able to keep a record of all previous information ever exposed to including where and when it was experienced and all contextual details of the experience.  
* Being able to search across all previous experiences to provide examples of every occasion when a particular object has been encountered and the contexts of those encounters.  
* Being able to keep track of a conversational partner’'s changing preferences/views/statements across multiple years of conversation, noting the context and timings of change in preference and combining with world knowledge to identify a pattern (for example “you tend to make negative comments about your job following visits to see your family. After you have spent time away with work colleagues you tend to make positive comments about your work. Do you think interacting with your parents or siblings changes your perception of your job?” )
