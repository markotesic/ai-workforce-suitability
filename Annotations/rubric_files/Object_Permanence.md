# **Object Permanence**

This rubric assesses a system’s ability to keep track of objects that disappear from direct view, reasoning that they continue to exist, retain (or predictably change) key properties and can later be re-identified. Tasks rise in difficulty from those needing no such tracking to challenges that require maintaining several occluded objects, over long delays, while updating beliefs about possible changes in location, identity, or state.

## **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without assuming hidden objects persist; all relevant entities remain visible or explicitly stated. No memory of occluded items or properties is required at any point.

**Examples:**

* Read a list of five visible tools and pick the heaviest.  
* Copy an on-screen table exactly as shown.  
* Name the colour of the object depicted in a single static image.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level require acknowledging that a briefly hidden object still exists and remains the same when it reappears after a short, obvious occlusion. Minimal temporal tracking is needed because the object comes back into view.

**Examples:**

* A picture shows a ball rolled behind a curtain and re-appearing unchanged; state whether it is the same ball.  
* Alice places her keys in the drawer, closes it, then opens it immediately. When Alice looks in the drawer, does she see her keys?  
* In a short story, a silver ring is placed inside a small box, the lid is shut while a ribbon is tied around it, and the lid is reopened moments later. State whether the ring is still in the box.

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require tracking an object across a longer delay or distraction and assuming it continues to exist in the same hidden location, even when it cannot be seen. Stable properties (e.g., size, colour) allow re-identification when extra objects are introduced.

**Examples:**

* A comic strip shows a small red cube sliding behind a wall for three panels. Later, two cubes emerge, one red, one blue. Identify which is the original.  
* Two identical cups are shown; one is filled with water, the other is empty. Both are covered with identical napkins. Identify which napkin now hides the cup with water.  
* Read a short narrative where a package is placed in Locker 7, lockers are shut, a janitor sweeps the hall, then you’re asked which locker still contains the package.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Tasks at this level require tracking two or three occluded objects simultaneously, each with distinct properties, through short relocations or swaps. Distractor events may occur, and correct re-identification hinges on monitoring one or more attributes (e.g., colour, speed, damage) even when cues are subtle or partially described.

**Examples:**

* An image sequence shows a red ball, blue cube, and green cone rolling behind three doors. The objects then shuffle positions once out of sight. Specify which door hides the cone.  
* Two identical balls roll behind a screen; one is moving fast, the other slow. When one emerges, identify which it is based on speed alone.  
* Three roommates move their identical closed laptops between desks; one laptop has a cracked screen. After reading a paragraph describing their moves, indicate where the cracked laptop ends up.

## **Level 4: High**

Tasks at this level require long-span tracking of several objects whose properties or positions may change in predictable ways (e.g., damage, alteration, transformation) while occluded. The solver must update expectations, ignore misleading cues, and re-identify each item despite appearance changes that could confuse identity.

**Examples:**

* A museum loans out four artworks for restoration. When returned, one painting is brighter from cleaning, another has a repaired corner, and frames have been swapped. Match each restored piece back to its original wall location, recognising them despite predictable alterations.  
* Read a two-page story about a travelling circus: performers swap costumes offstage, a lion is dyed for a show, and props are repainted between acts. Identify which performer or prop is which when they reappear, accounting for the changes.  
* A figure-sequence shows three robots (1–3) walking behind partitions. While occluded, one swaps its red hat for a blue one, another gains a dent on its chest, and the third remains unchanged. When they emerge, determine which is which.

## **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks at this level demand tracking many objects (≥4) across overlapping occlusions, ambiguous transformations, or probabilistic property changes over extended narratives. Success hinges on maintaining and updating a dynamic mental model, reconciling uncertainties, and selecting the most plausible re-identifications under complex and sometimes conflicting constraints. The solution strategy may vary: deductive elimination, probabilistic inference, or heuristic reasoning.

**Examples:**

* Read a 5,000-word spy report describing five identical cars entering separate garages, two documented car swaps, one repaint while inside, and an explosion. Decide which agent’s original car is now missing, justifying your inference despite incomplete information.  
* Follow a multi-panel comic where six coloured marbles enter a branching tube system. Some junctions are visible, others hidden, and certain hidden chambers are marked as possibly mixing colours. Deduce the most likely colour and exit order of the marbles.  
* In a logistics scenario, eight cargo drones (some with interchangeable high-capacity batteries) disappear into three large hangars during a storm. Inside, drones may autonomously swap batteries if their models are compatible. Over two hours, the drones re-emerge. Determine which ones are most likely to retain their original high-capacity packs, explaining your reasoning.
