# **Procedural Memory**

This rubric assesses procedural memory, i.e. the long-term retention of *how to do things*—sequences of actions, operations, or stimulus-response associations that have become automatised through practice. Difficulty rises from items that need no procedure at all to those that demand intricate, hierarchical routines that adapt to cues, probabilistic patterns, and potential contingencies.

## **Level 0: None**

The question can be answered by recalling a fact or making a single judgment; no learned procedure, sequence, or motor-schema needs to be accessed.

**Examples:**

* “What is the capital of Japan?”  
* “Is water a liquid at 25 °C?”  
* “Define the word *photosynthesis*.”

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Success depends on a very short, over-learned routine of one or two steps with no conditional branches; executing it feels almost reflexive.

**Examples:**

* Describing, step by step, how to log into a website using a username and password.  
* Make the word ‘important’ bold in Markdown.  
* Convert the sentence ‘The cat chases the mouse’ into passive voice, step by step.

## **Level 2: Low**

Executing a short, fixed sequence of 3–5 ordered actions with minimal branching, where the steps are known or inferable but not routinely practiced; careful adherence is needed to avoid error.

**Examples:**

* Write the Markdown for a 2-column, 3-row table: first the header row, then the separator row, then two data rows, each on its own line.  
* Format the raw reference Smith J 2022 Deep Learning Trends arXiv:2201.12345 into APA 7th style, listing the ordered steps.  
* Set the digital clock to 7:30am.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

The task requires executing or explaining a longer or conditionally branching sequence whose steps must be followed in the correct order; errors propagate if steps are skipped or out of place.

**Examples:**

* Performing long multiplication of two two-digit numbers, showing each partial product and carry.  
* Outlining the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 42 and 70\.  
* Outline the exact command‑line sequence to initialise a Git repository, add all files, commit with the message ‘init’, create a remote on GitHub named origin, and push the main branch.

## **Level 4: High**

Achieving the correct answer relies on a complex, hierarchical, or pattern-driven procedure, for example, recognising and extending a hidden stimulus sequence, using nested loops, or switching sub-routines based on cues.

**Examples:**

* List every item in the Cessna 172 pre‑flight checklist from Cabin Documents through Flight Controls in proper order.  
* Describe the hierarchical algorithm, case recognition and finger‑trick sequence, that solves all four last‑layer corners on a 4 × 4 Rubik’s Cube at competition speed.  
* Give the coordinated sequence a licensed electrician follows to de‑energise, remove, replace, and re‑energise a three‑phase distribution board in a commercial building, including lock‑out/tag‑out, voltage verification, conductor sizing and load‑balancing checks, torque specification adherence, insulation‑resistance testing, and earth‑fault loop impedance measurement, all to national electrical‑code standards.

## **Level 5: Very High**

The item demands intricate, domain-specific procedural schemas that integrate probabilistic cues, adapt to novel contexts, or unfold over many steps with multiple levels of sub-goal management. These abilities are typically honed by extensive practice and often executed implicitly.

**Examples:**

* Detail the complete sequence of mission‑control commands and verifications required to rendezvous and dock a Crew Dragon capsule with the International Space Station.  
* Outline the complete startup procedure for a pressurised‑water nuclear reactor from cold shutdown to full power, including reactor‑coolant heat‑up and pressurisation, control‑rod withdrawal sequencing, criticality monitoring, turbine synchronisation, and mandatory safety verifications in accordance with NRC regulations and plant technical specifications  
* Outline the complete calibration and bring-up of a multi-extruder FFF 3D printer from setup to production-ready prints, covering frame squaring and belt tension, bed tramming/mesh levelling, hotend PID tuning, E-steps/flow calibration, resonance characterisation and input-shaping, pressure-advance tuning, tool offsets and ooze control, slicer tool-change settings, and final validation via first-layer and dimensional tests per manufacturer/firmware guidelines.
