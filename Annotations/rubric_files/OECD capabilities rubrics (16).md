# **Emotion Perception & Empathy (EPE)**

This rubric assesses emotion perception and empathy required in recognising, interpreting, and adapting to the feelings of others in a task. Difficulty rises from tasks that need no emotional reading to those that demand nuanced understanding of multiple agents’ affective states as well as appropriate, context-sensitive responses.

### **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without attending to anyone’s feelings; only factual or structural information matters.

**Examples:**

* List three countries that border Germany.  
* Alphabetise these four words: posh, ghost, head, home  
* Convert 42°C to Fahrenheit.

### **Level 1: Very Low**

A single, explicit emotion is stated or blatantly signalled; recognising it or mirroring a matching tone is helpful but straightforward.

**Examples**

* Identify the speaker's emotions when they say ‘I’m so excited about my promotion\!’  
* Choose the emoji (😊 / 😢 / 😡) that best matches: ‘My phone was just stolen\! I’m furious\!’  
* Respond with one sentence that matches the happy tone of: *‘*Can’t wait for the weekend\!’

### **Level 2: Low**

A short passage implies (does not state) how one person’s is feeling; you must infer it from context and reply or act appropriately.

**Examples**

* A colleague emails: *‘*I was up all night fixing those bugs… hope it was worth it.’ Write a two-sentence supportive reply acknowledging their likely emotion.  
* Given chat lines, pick which of four feelings (relief, frustration, curiosity, pride) best describes the speaker: *‘*Another delay? Great… just great.*’*  
* Rewrite a customer-service response so it reassures a user who hints at disappointment without saying so outright.

### **Level 3: Moderate**

Infer and adapt to changing or dual emotions in a single person or manage your wording so as not to intensify a sensitive feeling.

**Examples**

* During a 12-turn text counselling role-play, the user shifts from anger to sadness. Adjust your tone mid-session: validate anger early, then offer comfort when sadness cues appear.  
* Summarise a meeting transcript in 150 words without echoing the sarcastic frustration of one speaker, while still reflecting their viewpoint fairly.  
* After receiving a stern project-update request from a stressed manager, draft a response that provides clear data while defusing their anxiety.

### **Level 4: High**

Simultaneously track and respond to several people’s differing emotions, some in conflict, within one conversation.

**Examples**

* Moderate a three-person Slack debate where Alice is defensive, Bob is mocking, and Chen is anxious; write one post that addresses each emotion and steers the group back to the agenda.  
* Draft a project-status email to both an impatient executive and a worried engineer, satisfying the executive’s demand for brevity while reassuring the engineer their concerns are heard.  
* Rewrite a team retrospective report so it celebrates successes without triggering the guilt expressed by underperforming members.

### **Level 5: Very High**

Manage and influence a dynamic web of emotions across multiple stakeholders over an extended exchange, anticipating ripple effects.

**Examples**

* Draft a sequence of five internal company updates over two weeks following a sudden round of layoffs: start by acknowledging employees’ shock and fear, then gradually shift toward empathy, reassurance about job security, and concrete recovery plans, all while anticipating and addressing potential anger, rumours, and morale issues surfacing in staff discussions.  
* Lead a 20-message text negotiation among three startups and an investor: balance founder enthusiasm, investor skepticism, and silent partner anxiety, tactically revealing information to keep all parties engaged and cooperative.  
* Write a HR mediation transcript in which two colleagues misinterpret each other’s motives; over six back-and-forth turns, surface hidden resentment, validate both perspectives, and guide them to a mutually acceptable action plan.
