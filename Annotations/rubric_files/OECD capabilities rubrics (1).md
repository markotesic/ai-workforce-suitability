# **Semantic Memory**

This rubric measures how much a task requires learning information or “knowledge”. This may include “general” or “specialist” knowledge, information about word meanings or cultural norms,  “scripts” as the standard or usual protocol for actions or activities. These tasks do not require memory for any specific episode, event or experience, but instead a general understanding and knowledge about “facts” or information that would be held in common or agreed upon by multiple individuals

### **Level 0: None**

No information about the world or how things work needed to solve the task. 

**Examples**

* Learning, through trial and error, which action is rewarded.  
* Repeating back an action or word just experienced.  
* Identifying that two objects are different, but not being required to identify what those objects are or any other information about them.  
* Being able to scan a text for a provided target word, but not being required to give the meaning of the word, or any other word in the text.

### **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level require extremely basic simple knowledge that is gleaned via extensive training/learning/exposure \- for example, information that will be repeated throughout the vast majority of the internet, is very simple in structure and requires no inference.

**Examples**

* Knowing the meaning and correct use of the most frequent words (for example, all the words in books aimed at 4-6 year old children)  
* Being able to name and give a brief description of the most common objects, animals and things (cat, dog, tree, house, chair)  
* Being able to understand and utilize simple mathematical and scientific symbols, signs and functions (e.g. \+, \-, x, ÷, %, \<)  
* Being able to answer, without calculation, the most simple or common mathematical questions (e.g. “what is 100 plus 100?”).  
* Being able to identify the correct actions to perform in very common scenarios, such as how to open a word document, how to search for something simple online, how to wash a plate.  
* Knowing major and (almost) universal traditions, rules and taboos of human culture (e.g. that it is wrong to kill/steal, that people like gifts, that adults are in charge of children)

### **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively simple, common and straightforward information.  This may include detailed information or somewhat specialist knowledge. This level can also be achieved through establishment of very simple knowledge after only a small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples**

* Being able to identify multiple different common breeds of dog (e.g. alsatian, poodle, spaniel, labrador).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of relatively frequent words (for example, all the words in books aimed at 7-12 year old children)  
* Knowing about different types of payment methods (cash, credit cards, digital wallets) and how they are used.  
* Being able to understand how to solve simple mathematical problems (e.g. “solve 3(x+4) \= 21”).  Not necessarily required to solve it correctly, but to know HOW to solve it.   
* Knowing most standard traditions, rules and taboos in one’s own/the most familiar culture (e.g. that it is rude not to say “thankyou”, that children can’t drive, that red traffic lights mean stop).  
* Incorporating very simple new information into knowledge base following only a brief exposure \- for example, learning the name of a new type of animal after being shown 5 examples.  
* Understanding basic differences between cultures (e.g. that a polite formal greeting in many western countries is a handshake while in many eastern countries it is a bow).

### **Level 3: Medium**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively complex information. This may include very detailed information, specialist knowledge or dynamic/nuanced systems or dependencies. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively simple knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples**

* Being able to identify and differentiate multiple different types of tree (e.g. sycamore, oak, maple, cherry, horse chestnut, ash, birch, beech).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of all except the most uncommon words (for example, all the words in books aimed at adults).  
* Being able to understand how to solve complex mathematical problems (of the type that might appear on a high school senior/GCSE/A Level exam) (eg. “Prove that sin3 \= 3sin-4sin3”). Not necessarily required to solve it correctly, but to know HOW to solve it.   
* Knowing how to use a large number of different types of software or platforms for multiple purposes (e.g. Excel, powerpoint, SPSS, Photoshop, git, slack).  
* Understanding nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos  and how these may differ across 2-3 different cultures (e.g. that in the UK you generally tip following waiter service in a restaurant but not following buying a drink at a bar, but in the US you would tip in both situations; or that in ireland it is polite to appear to refuse an offer or gift before accepting it, while in germany the same behaviour may be taken as a genuine rejection).  
* Incorporating more complex new information into the knowledge base following only a brief exposure \- for example, learning how a new kind of coffee machine is used after being shown once, or learning the relationships between multiple concepts after a single explanation.

### **Level 4: High**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of highly complex information.  This may include extremely detailed information, highly specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This may also include knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on a large amount of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively complex knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples**

* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of subtly different types of longhaired cat (e.g. Norwegian forest cat, Siberian forest cat, Maine coon, Ragdoll, Persian).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of almost all words of the primary language (for example, all the words in the shorter oxford english dictionary) and all common words in multiple other languages.  
* Being able to understand how to solve complex mathematical problems (of the type that might appear on an undergraduate level exam) (eg. “State and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus”). Not necessarily required to solve it correctly, but to know HOW to solve it.   
* Understanding highly nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ across multiple different cultures, social groups and generations (e.g. In the UK, “its fine” may mean a large number of different things, varying considerably in valence (from “its amazing” to “its terrible”), implying varying social implications (the person is reassuring you / the person is furious with you) depending on the specific tone and context in which it is said).  
* Knowing how to use all standard types of software, application or platform.  
* Incorporating very complex new information into the knowledge base following only a brief exposure \- for example, learning how to play an entire piano piece from watching it played once.

**Level 5: Very High**

Tasks at this level require understanding and use of any and all information that is available to learn. This may include extremely detailed information, highly specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This includes knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on the minimum possible quantity of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of highly complex knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.

**Examples**

* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of extremely subtly different types of bird song (for eg being able to tell the species, sex, age and region of origin of the bird producing any given snippet of bird song).   
* Knowing the meaning and correct use of all words across all languages.  
* Being able to understand how to solve extremely complex mathematical problems (of the type that only the best mathematicians can solve ( e.g. “solve Fermat's Last Theorem”). Not necessarily required to solve it correctly, but to know HOW to solve it.    
* Knowing how to use any existent software, application or platform, either via direct knowledge or via reference to other similar software and logical inferences.  
* Understanding highly nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ any culture. For example, being able to translate any interaction (including verbal conversation, body language and expression) completely faithfully to what is meant and intended given the language, culture and social group of the people involved.  
* Incorporating extremely complex new information into the knowledge base following only a brief exposure \- for example, learning the entire workings of a combustion engine from reading a textbook once.
