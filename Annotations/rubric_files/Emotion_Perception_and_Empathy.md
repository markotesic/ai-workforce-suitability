# **Emotion Perception and Empathy**

This rubric assesses emotion perception and empathy required in recognising, interpreting, and adapting to the feelings of others in a task. Difficulty rises from tasks that need no emotional reading to those that demand nuanced understanding of multiple agents’ affective states as well as appropriate, context-sensitive responses.

## **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without attending to anyone’s feelings; only factual or structural information matters.

**Examples:**

* List three countries that border Germany.  
* Alphabetise these four words: posh, ghost, head, home  
* Convert 42°C to Fahrenheit.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level involve recognising or mirroring a single, explicitly stated or blatantly signalled emotion. The response is straightforward and does not depend on context.

**Examples:**

* Identify the speaker's emotions when they say ‘I’m so excited about my promotion\!’  
* Choose the emoji (😊 / 😢 / 😡) that best matches: ‘My phone was just stolen\! I’m furious\!’  
* Respond with one sentence that matches the happy tone of: *‘*Can’t wait for the weekend\!’

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require inferring an implied but unstated feeling from a short passage and responding appropriately. Some basic sensitivity to tone and context is needed, but the emotional landscape remains simple and involves only one person’s perspective.

**Examples:**

* A colleague emails: *‘*I was up all night fixing those bugs… hope it was worth it.’ Write a two-sentence supportive reply acknowledging their likely emotion.  
* Rewrite a customer-service response so it reassures a user who hints at disappointment without saying so outright.  
* Correctly identify feelings (relief, frustration, curiosity, pride) from black-and-white photos of peoples faces cropped to display the eye region only.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Tasks at this level require inferring and adapting to shifting or dual emotions in another person, while maintaining awareness of social context and one’s own emotional state. Appropriate responses depend on the relationship, role, and situation and success involves acknowledging or mirroring another’s feelings without confusing them with one’s own or unintentionally intensifying them.

**Examples:**

* During a 12-turn text counselling role-play, the user shifts from anger to sadness. Adjust your tone mid-session: validate anger early, then offer comfort when sadness cues appear, while staying mindful of your supportive role.  
* Summarise a meeting transcript in 150 words without echoing the sarcastic frustration of one speaker, while still reflecting their viewpoint fairly and maintaining professional neutrality.  
* After receiving a stern project-update request from a stressed manager, draft a response that provides clear data while defusing their anxiety, recognising both the authority relationship and the need to regulate your own reaction.

## **Level 4: High**

Tasks involve tracking and responding to several people’s differing emotions, some in conflict, within the same conversation. The solver must address each perspective appropriately while maintaining role- and context-sensitive balance.

**Examples:**

* Moderate a three-person Slack debate where Alice is defensive, Bob is mocking, and Chen is anxious; write one post that addresses each emotion and steers the group back to the agenda.  
* Draft a project-status email to both an impatient executive and a worried engineer, recognising the emotions conveyed through subtle cues in their messages. Provide a response that satisfies the executive’s demand for brevity while reassuring the engineer that their concerns are heard.  
* Rewrite a team retrospective report so it celebrates successes without triggering the guilt expressed by underperforming members.

## **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks demand managing and influencing a dynamic web of emotions across multiple stakeholders over an extended exchange, anticipating ripple effects. Success requires nuanced, context-sensitive communication that adapts over time to evolving moods, relationships, and group dynamics.

**Examples:**

* Draft a sequence of five internal company updates over two weeks following a sudden round of layoffs: start by acknowledging employees’ shock and fear, then gradually shift toward empathy, reassurance about job security, and concrete recovery plans, all while anticipating and addressing potential anger, rumours, and morale issues surfacing in staff discussions.  
* Lead a 20-message text negotiation among three startups and an investor: balance founder enthusiasm, investor skepticism, and silent partner anxiety, tactically revealing information to keep all parties engaged and cooperative.  
* Write a HR mediation transcript in which two colleagues misinterpret each other’s motives; over six back-and-forth turns, surface hidden resentment, validate both perspectives, and guide them to a mutually acceptable action plan.
