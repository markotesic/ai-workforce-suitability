# **Functional perception**

This rubric gauges how much a task relies on recognising functional perception, that is understanding what roles objects, people, or pieces of information can play in achieving a goal.  Difficulty climbs from tasks that require no functional reasoning, through obvious one-to-one matches, to challenges that demand spotting subtle or novel uses amid multiple, interacting constraints.

## **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without considering how anything might be used; rote recall, copying, or direct lookup is sufficient. Ignoring functional properties does not harm performance.

**Examples**:

* Copy a block of code exactly as shown.  
* List the seven continents.  
* Alphabetise a list of 50 surnames in strict ascending order, preserving each name’s original capitalisation and spacing.

## **Level 1: Very low**

Success requires spotting a single, obvious function an object or a person serves that most people recognise instantly. The mapping is one-to-one and literal with no competing options.

**Examples**:

* From {scissors, spoon, pencil}, choose the item best suited to cut paper.  
* Identify which profession (doctor, chef, lawyer) can diagnose an illness.  
* Select the file type that can store a photo: PNG, MP3, or TXT.

## **Level 2: Low**

The solver must choose correctly among a few alternatives by matching a basic property to a goal (e.g., strength, heat-resistance). A modest amount of inference or prior knowledge is helpful, but the rule stays concrete.

**Examples**:

* Given a shelf rated for 20kg and a 25kg box, decide if the shelf is an appropriate support and justify it in one sentence.  
* Pick the best container to transport hot soup: plastic grocery bag, paper coffee cup, or insulated thermos and explain why.  
* From these file formats {CSV, MP3, and PDF} pick the one you would use to share a 20-page, text-and-figure research report with colleagues, and state in one sentence why it is the appropriate choice.

## **Level 3: Moderate**

Tasks require integrating multiple functional attributes or contextual constraints and ruling out distractors. Accurate mapping of roles demands careful consideration of how each attribute interacts within the given context.

**Examples**:

* You must hang a 15 kg mirror on drywall: choose the correct fastener system from four options and explain how each component (stud, toggle bolt, adhesive) contributes.  
* A startup needs legal advice on IP, tax, and HR; assign the right type of lawyer to each issue from a mixed candidate list, giving one-sentence rationales.  
* From eight kitchen tools, select the three that let you zest a lemon, whip cream and measure 5 ml salt, making sure none has an overlapping function.

## **Level 4: High**

The solver must evaluate multiple interacting goals and constraints (cost, safety, time) and map them onto a set of heterogeneous resources whose affordances partly overlap or conflict. Reasoning often relies on domain knowledge plus logical elimination.

**Examples**:

* Given terrain, weather, and casualty descriptions, choose whether a drone, helicopter, or ground team should deliver medical supplies, and justify trade-offs in one paragraph.  
* Design a data-backup plan using SSDs, magnetic tape, and cloud storage to balance cost, latency, and durability under three failure scenarios.  
* From a pool of ten staff profiles, assemble a project team that covers required skills (UX, backend, compliance) while respecting stated workload limits.

## **Level 5: Very high**

Tasks demand recognising non-obvious or novel functions and affordances across many elements under high uncertainty, often inventing unconventional uses while balancing competing constraints. Success requires synthesising diverse knowledge domains to uncover creative functional mappings that are not apparent from surface features.

**Examples**:

* Plan how to convert surplus shipping containers into a 50-bed modular clinic, detailing which container features (corrugation strength, corner castings) support structural, plumbing, and electrical needs.  
* In a disaster-response scenario with damaged infrastructure, outline how to repurpose personal smartphones, delivery trucks, and retail Wi-Fi routers into an ad-hoc communication network that meets bandwidth and power constraints.  
* Given a 10-page organisational chart and a sudden cybersecurity breach, reassign roles, temporarily turning HR staff into incident liaisons and junior developers into log reviewers, while explaining the functional rationale for each reassignment.
