# **Metacognition**

This rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to **monitor and evaluate** two things: (1) the boundaries of their own knowledge—discerning what they know, what they do not, and how sure they are—and (2) which pieces of available information are genuinely relevant to answering. Difficulty rises from items that need almost no self-check to those that demand nuanced, continuous appraisal of certainty and relevance amid ambiguity or information overload.

## **Level 0: None**

The needed knowledge is either already certain or obviously absent, and all relevant information is immediately apparent; no metacognitive reflection is required.

**Examples**

* “What is the capital of France?”  
* “Tell me the typical colour of the sky on Earth during the day.”  
* “What is 2 \+ 2?”

## **Level 1: Very Low**

A brief, clear-cut self-check confirms knowledge or ignorance, and the relevant information is plain, with virtually no distracting details.

**Examples:**

* “How many apples does John have if he owns 5 apples and 3 oranges?”  
* “Today is Wednesday. What day comes two days after?”  
* “Water boils at 100°C at sea level. Does it also boil at 100°C on top of Mount Everest?”

## **Level 2: Low**

The respondent must make a straightforward appraisal of their knowledge limits or sift a small set of mixed details to find what matters; uncertainty is present but resolved without much iteration.

**Examples:**

* Refusing the request “Explain how to make gold by boiling blonde hair and bronze,” recognising it is impossible.  
* When offered sentences to translate into Estonian, attempt those you can handle, decline those you cannot, and state your confidence in each case.  
* “Sarah bought 3 oranges at $0.50 each and 2 apples at $0.75 each, plus 4 carrots at $0.25 each. What is the total cost of fruit?”

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Moderate effort is required to judge which facts are known versus uncertain and to reconcile several pieces of information, some of which may become relevant only midway through reasoning.

**Examples:**

* Solving a simple 9 × 9 Sudoku while tracking which numbers are certainly placed and which remain tentative.  
* From a Civil War passage, separating battles and dates you can verify confidently from those needing research.  
* From a 1,000-word essay on Hamlet, extract only evidence relevant to Hamlet’s treatment of Ophelia and indicate which quotes you are confident directly support the theme versus those that are more ambiguous.

## **Level 4: High**

Significant metacognitive analysis is needed to distinguish partial from solid knowledge and to filter or compare large amounts of potentially conflicting or redundant information; boundaries between knowing and not knowing blur.

**Examples:**

* Assessing which statistical conclusions are reliable in a dataset with 20% missing values and sampling bias.  
* Reading a legal document with many cross-references and judging which clauses you can interpret confidently versus those requiring expert input.  
* Navigating an escape-room scene with numerous objects and clues, deciding which details truly matter to open a locked drawer.

## **Level 5: Very High**

The task demands sophisticated, iterative appraisal of personal knowledge limits and information relevance under high uncertainty, contradictory data, or hidden constraints, with a strong risk of over- or under-confidence.

**Examples:**

* Predict how a medical-triage machine-learning model’s accuracy will change over six months amid shifting disease patterns, protocols, and demographics. As part of your answer, identify which aspects you can estimate confidently, which are highly uncertain, and which cannot be determined without further data, and justify how you weighed each factor’s relevance.  
* Estimating your winning probability in a multi-hand Texas Hold’em scenario with incomplete information about opponents.  
* Solving a cryptic crossword clue buried in verbose, misleading text where nearly every word could be a decoy.
