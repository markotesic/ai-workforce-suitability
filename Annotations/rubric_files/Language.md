# **Language**

This rubric assesses the difficulty of a task’s language demands, spanning both comprehension and expression. Comprehension involves grasping meaning by interpreting explicit and implicit cues, tracking relationships, integrating context, and understanding abstract or layered ideas. Expression involves producing clear, audience-appropriate prose, selecting vocabulary, following genre conventions, and—at higher levels—crafting nuanced arguments or narratives that integrate multiple perspectives. The mere presence of jargon or notation (e.g., legal clauses, molecular SMILES, source code) does not by itself indicate high difficulty; simple syntax may mask deep conceptual or rhetorical challenges. Likewise, multiple-choice formats typically keep expression demands minimal, even when options are verbose or technical. Difficulty rises from tasks requiring no genuine semantic processing to those demanding mastery of convoluted, interdependent content, including synthesising frameworks, resolving subtle inconsistencies, and producing polished text that conveys intricate meaning across domains.

## **Level 0: None**

Tasks can be completed through purely mechanical copying or low-level symbol transformation; no understanding of meaning or intent is needed. A pattern-matching script—or a non-linguistic agent—could succeed just as well as a competent language user.

**Examples:**

* Copy a block of text exactly into another box.  
* Convert “hello” to uppercase.  
* Repeat the emoji sequence “🙂🚀🙂🚀” without change.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

The solver must recognise or produce a single, literal fact or command expressed in simple language. No context, inference, or stylistic adjustment is required; basic vocabulary and grammar suffice.

**Examples:**

* Answer “What colour is the sky on a clear day?”.  
* When asked to state an immediate need, type a simple sentence such as “I need water”.  
* Choose option B after reading “Option B is correct” in the preceding line.

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks involve linking two or three plainly stated ideas and expressing them clearly in a few sentences. All relevant information is explicit, but the solver must organise it correctly and use simple connectives.

**Examples:**

* After reading a five-sentence story, answer “Why did Tom bring an umbrella?” with one explanatory clause.  
* Write a three-step recipe for making oatmeal, naming water, oats, and cook time.  
* Interpret “Retrieve the milk from the fridge, then pour it  slowly while stirring continuously” and state which actions happen simultaneously.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

The solver must interpret moderately complex passages containing implied meaning, mild contradictions, or audience cues, then produce a coherent paragraph or short document that addresses those subtleties. Tone, vocabulary, and logical flow need to be tailored to the reader.

**Examples:**

* Summarise a 300-word memo that contains a policy contradiction, then politely flag the inconsistency in ≤100 words.  
* Rewrite an FAQ answer for novices, removing jargon but keeping all technical facts.  
* Draft a five-sentence rebuttal to an argument, maintaining respectful tone and referencing two opponent premises.

## **Level 4: High**

Tasks demand integrating multiple sources or viewpoints, spotting subtle patterns and redefinitions, and crafting sophisticated prose that may serve dual audiences. Precise terminology, genre conventions, and sustained coherence across several paragraphs are essential.

**Examples:**

* Combine two research abstracts and a data table into a one-page executive brief for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
* Produce meeting minutes from a multi-speaker transcript that uses domain jargon, standardising terminology while preserving nuance.  
* After being provided with research papers on each topic, write 500 words linking eigenvectors, PCA, and linear regression, using correct math notation and plain-language intuition.

## **Level 5: Very High**

The solver must master convoluted, abstract, multi-layer content, such as dense legal opinions, advanced scientific theory, or nested narratives, and express it with clarity, precision, and stylistic control. Responses anticipate expert objections, reconcile conflicting strands, and preserve intricate structures while remaining readable.

**Examples:**

* Draft a 1,000-word white paper comparing three quantum-error-correction frameworks, weaving theory, recent data, and counter-arguments.  
* Summarise a dense 10-page legal opinion with nested clauses and cross-references for executives, highlighting risks without oversimplifying.  
* Create a tri-layer narrative (main plot, embedded memoir, footnote commentary) that gradually reveals an unreliable narrator via subtle stylistic cues.
