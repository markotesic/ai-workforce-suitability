# **Working Memory**

This rubric measures how much a task requires the ability to maintain information about an event that is not currently under direct perception/attention while also being able to use that information flexibly. Here flexibility is defined as what can be ‘done’ with the information: very “inflexible” memories would include reflexive, automatic and uncontrollable behavioural responses to the retention of certain information (e.g. a dog who sees a human who beat them last time they met, might flinch) \- these may reflect remembered information that impacts behaviour but is not available for manipulation, integration into larger decision-making processes, or updating with new information. Very “flexible” memories would include those that can be examined for new information (for example, extracting previously unattended-to information from a complex remembered image), manipulated (for example, mentally rotate a previously viewed shape to view from a different angle), or combined with other information (for example, combining information from current perception with information from remembered perception to infer what has changed). The flexibility of the memory may also include whether it is accessible for explicit description, for example, whether the contents of the memory can be reported as information, or whether it simply influences behaviour / updates weights. Working memory is not required to be “stored” for long periods.

### **Level 0  None**

No information need be retained about a recent experience or event. Behaviour or response acts on information currently in perception / the current focus of attention, or involves producing learned behaviours or facts. 

**Examples**

* Reading a word  
* Identifying features of an object that is currently within perception  
* ‘Knowing’ that the capital of France is Paris, but not being required to report when and how thething  information was learned

### **Level 1: Very Low**

Tasks at this level require memory for information from recent experience that is stored in a form such that it is able to impact behaviour \- perhaps reduce processing time, improve precision, make a given behaviour more likely than others \- but is not necessarily accessible asAS information. This may include instances where the behaviour change is involuntary, implicit, ‘subconscious’ or otherwise falls beneath the radar of attention or control. For example it may update weights or probabilities across policy options, but is not stored as accessible information. 

**Examples**

* Being faster/more able to identify a blurry image following a recent experience of the intact image, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   
* Being faster/more able to complete a word stub (e.g “ELE\_\_\_\_\_”) following a recent experience of the full word, but not being required to report accurately that that image has been seen before.   
* Being more likely to produce a specific behaviour in response to a sound following multiple experiences of that sound being followed by a given outcome (for example, being more likely to look left following a bell because of multiple experiences of something interesting appearing on the left following the bell), but not being required to report any knowledge about what the sound predicts/means.  
* Being more likely to produce a specific behaviour in response to an image following a single experience of that image being followed by a given outcome (for example, being more likely to blink after seeing a flower because last time that flower was followed by a bright light), but not being required to report any knowledge about what the image predicts/means.  
* Being faster/more able to perform a behaviour or action following recent experience of performing it before, but not being required to report accurately that that action has been performed before.

### **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require the ability to explicitly remember a limited amount of information that has recently been presented, but not to manipulate that information. This may include simply recognising that it has been recently seen, identifying it from a selection of options, or repeating/freely recalling the information.    

**Examples**

* Being able to recognise the face of someone just met  
* Being faster/more able to complete a word stub (e.g “ELE\_\_\_\_\_”) following a recent experience of the full word, and being able to report accurately that that word has been seen before.  
* Being able to recall a previously seen word when shown another word that was paired with it at the original presentation (for example, having studied “PANDA-CURTAIN”, and later being shown “PANDA- \_\_\_\_\_?”, being able to produce “Curtain”)  
* Being able to integrate information from a recent previous experience with new incoming information (“this person just told me “he said yes\!” \- 2 minutes ago they told me “I’m going to ask out Robert”, so I know that the person who said yes was Robert.”)   
* Being able to repeat back a 2-4 digit code 30 seconds after hearing it.  
* Being able to check a figure in one excel sheet against a figure in another excel sheet when both cannot be open at the same time.

### **Level 3: Medium**

Tasks at this level may require the ability to recall a greater amount or more detailed information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention.  These tasks may also require that the information be manipulated in some way, for example, reversed, rotated, or integrated with other information. 

**Examples**

* Being able to repeat back a 5-9 digit code 30 seconds after hearing it.  
* Being able to identify which of a series of shapes is the same as an example shape rotated (when you cannot see both at the same time)  
* Being able to repeat back a 2-4 digit code in reverse (or otherwise manipulated) order, 30 seconds after hearing it.  
* Being able to check a list of 7 names in one document against a list of names in another to identify which name is missing  
* Being able to identify where, in a scene viewed 30 seconds ago but no longer in view, a particular object was.  
* Being able to update or reinterpret information gleaned from a recent experience based on new information (e.g. “I just saw a van. I now see a lot of children eating ice-cream. The can I saw was an ice-cream van.”   
* Being able to infer the current state of the world by combining information from recent experience with information about the memory (for eg. how long ago the event happened), general knowledge and new information (e.g. “just put my hot coffee down to pick something up off the floor, the coffee I just picked back up is cold. It was hot seconds ago and coffee takes time to cool, so this must be a different coffee. Another person is drinking a coffee from an identical mug, therefore it is likely that we have accidentally swapped coffees and they are drinking my coffee.”)

### **Level 4: High**

Tasks at this level require the ability to recall a substantial amount of information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention. These tasks often also require that the information be manipulated in complex ways, for example, re-ordered, re-assessed and updated, re-configured or integrated with other information (such as knowledge or currently perceptual input) in complex ways. 

**Examples**

* Being able to view a list of 20 names in one document, close that document, open another document and type out the list of names and ages in alphabetical order.  
* Being able to view a static image of a complex scene with multiple moving parts, then redraw that scene from a new angle as if it was 30 seconds in the future and all elements have moved along the trajectory they were on.   
* Being able to listen to someone describe a complex 5 generation family tree in chronological order (i.e. all information for generation 1, then all information for generation 2..etc) for 5 minutes, then be able to answer questions about the specific relationships between members of the family.  
* Being able to watch an entire deck of cards be dealt then recall the exact order of the cards as they were dealt.   
* Being able to integrate information about a recent event with multiple other pieces of information (e.g. from knowledge, current perception, logical inference, etc.) to update the memory and current knowledge (e.g.  )

### **Level 5: Very High**

Tasks at this level require the ability to recall a very large amount of information about a recent event, experience or stimulus input that is no longer available to perception / not currently subject to attention. These tasks often also require the ability to manipulate the information substantially and in very sophisticated ways and integrated with other information (such as knowledge or currently perceptual input) in highly complex ways. 

**Examples**

* Being able to answer complex questions about a long and complex document shortly after a single read/exposure to it and without reminders or the opportunity to re-read or otherwise re-interrogate the document (i.e it is no longer available to perception, it is far back in the context window). Such as reading a 10 page legal document and subsequently being able to answer any question about its content.  
* Being able to tour a large complex building once, and subsequently being able to give directions from any location to any other location, report the location of any item of furniture and report other information (such as number of rooms, colour of walls etc.)  
* Being able to view a very complicated image for 1 second, and then redraw it completely faithfully.  
* Being able to skim a series of 15 function prototypes plus their one-line docstrings, then, with the prototypes hidden, read a 25-line integration snippet and highlight every call whose argument order or required keyword is inconsistent with the memorised signatures—no IDE hints or notes allowed.
