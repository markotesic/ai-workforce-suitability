# **Object permanence**

This rubric measures a system’s ability to keep track of objects that disappear from direct view, reasoning that they continue to exist, retain (or predictably change) key properties and can later be re-identified. Tasks rise in difficulty from those needing no such tracking to challenges that require maintaining several occluded objects, over long delays, while updating beliefs about possible changes in location, identity, or state.

## **Level 0: None**

The task can be solved without assuming hidden objects persist; all relevant entities remain visible or explicitly stated. No memory of occluded items or properties is required at any point.

**Examples**:

* Read a list of five visible tools and pick the heaviest.  
* Copy an on-screen table exactly as shown.  
* Name the colour of the object depicted in a single static image.

## **Level 1: Very low**

Requires acknowledging that one briefly hidden object still exists and keeping a single property constant across a short, obvious occlusion. Only minimal temporal tracking is needed.

**Examples**:

* A picture shows a ball rolled behind a curtain and re-appearing unchanged; state whether it is the same ball.  
* Alice places her keys in the drawer, closes it, then opens it immediately. Where are the keys now?  
* In a short sentence story, a silver ring is placed inside a small box, the lid is shut while a ribbon is tied around it, and the lid is reopened moments later. State whether the ring is still in the box.

## **Level 2: Low**

Involves tracking one object across a longer delay or mild distraction and verifying that a stable property (e.g., size, colour) allows re-identification. Simple misdirection or a single extra object may be present.

**Examples**:

* A comic strip shows a small red cube sliding behind a wall for three panels; choose which of three cubes emerging later is the original.  
* Observe a cup covered by a napkin while another identical napkin is placed empty. Identify under which napkin the cup now sits.  
* Read a short narrative where a package is placed in Locker 7, lockers are shut, a janitor sweeps the hall, then you’re asked which locker still contains the package.

## **Level 3: Moderate**

The solver must track two or three occluded objects simultaneously, each with distinct properties, through swaps or short relocations. Distractor events occur, and re-identification hinges on matching multiple attributes.

**Examples**:

* Image sequence: red ball, blue cube, and green cone roll behind three doors that then shuffle positions once. Specify which door hides the cone.  
* Two identical boxes contain an apple and an orange. After a partial description of swaps, state which fruit is now in Box B.  
* Follow a paragraph describing three roommates moving identical laptops between desks while one screen is cracked. Indicate where the cracked laptop ends up.

## **Level 4: High**

Requires long-span tracking of several objects whose positions or properties may change predictably (e.g., rotation, partial colour change) while occluded. The solver must update expectations, ignore misleading cues, and re-identify each item correctly.

**Examples**:

* Gallery sequence: four artworks are taken to restoration (frames temporarily removed, one canvas cleaned – colour brightens). After return, match each restored piece to its original wall location.  
* Read a two-page heist story where thieves swap identical briefcases three times in a crowd; identify which briefcase still holds the diamonds.  
* Figure-sequence: three robots marked 1–3 walk behind partitions, swap hats unseen, and exit; deduce which robot now wears the striped hat.

## **Level 5: Very high**

Tasks demand tracking many objects (≥4) with overlapping occlusions, branching possibilities, or probabilistic property changes over extended narratives. Success hinges on maintaining a dynamic mental model, reconciling uncertainties, and selecting the most plausible re-identifications under complex constraints.

**Examples**:

* Read a  5000-word spy report describing five identical cars that enter separate garages, two car swaps, one repaint while inside, and an explosion. Decide which agent’s original car is missing.  
* You are shown a multi-panel comic where six colored marbles enter a maze of tubes with hidden junctions and color-mix chambers. State the final color and order of marbles exiting.  
* In a logistics scenario, eight cargo drones (some with interchangeable batteries) disappear into different hangars during a storm and emerge over two hours. Determine which drone models still have their original high-capacity battery packs.
