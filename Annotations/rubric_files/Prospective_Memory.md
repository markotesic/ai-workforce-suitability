# **Prospective Memory**

This rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to form and maintain an intended action and to later retrieve it at the correct moment, whether that moment is triggered by a time interval or by an external event, while other information or tasks compete for attention. Difficulty rises from items that need no delayed intention to those that demand highly complex, multi‑trigger monitoring amid heavy interference.

## **Level 0: None**

No delayed action is involved; the answer or action is immediate, with nothing to remember for the future.

**Examples:**

* Sort these four words alphabetically: kite, apple, zebra, mold.  
* Evaluate: 2x \+ 3 \= 11\. What is x?  
* Identify the verb in the sentence: ‘The children laughed loudly.

## **Level 1: Very Low**

A single, obvious action must be recalled after a brief, lightly distracting interval; the trigger is clear and salient.

**Examples:**

* After you read the next sentence, write the word ‘done’.  
* When you reach the end of this short three‑line poem, reply ‘clap’ once.  
* Remember to type ‘yes’ exactly 60 seconds after pressing Start.

## **Level 2: Low**

One action is maintained over a moderate delay while attention is partly occupied by a small ongoing task; the trigger is simple but not constantly in focus.

**Examples:**

* Read and copy the paragraph below; the first time the word ‘oven’ appears, insert ‘Set Timer’ and continue copying the rest unchanged.  
* Read a list of 12 integers; when you encounter the first prime number greater than 50, write ‘prime’.  
* Translate the following three Spanish sentences into English; after the third translation append ‘Check’.

## **Level 3: Intermediate**

Multiple actions or conditional triggers must be monitored during an ongoing activity; triggers may appear unpredictably, and failure to interrupt the primary task at the right moment invalidates success.

**Examples:**

* Summarise the article below; append ‘\[CIT\]’ after every sentence that contains both a four‑digit year and the word treaty, except the first time that pattern appears.  
* Solve 20 arithmetic questions one per line. Add each answer divisible by 7 to a running total unless it also ends in 9, in which case subtract 7 instead. After the twentieth question, report the final total.  
* Copy the 300‑word passage and enclose any palindrome of four or more letters in ⟨angle brackets⟩, but mark only the first occurrence of each distinct palindrome.

## **Level 4: High**

A hierarchy of intentions with overlapping or conflicting cues must be managed across a lengthy, information‑dense task; the respondent must discriminate relevant from irrelevant events and recover intentions amid significant distraction.

**Examples:**

* Rewrite the 1800‑word policy draft below. After every paragraph that both (a) contains a four‑digit year and (b) ends with a question mark, append ‘(cite?)’. After the fourth such tag, switch to appending ‘(verify)’ on subsequent matches, unless the paragraph begins with a quotation mark, in which case do not tag it at all.  
* Process 24 prescription lines (each with drug name and dosage in mg). Maintain a running total of all doses that are corticosteroids (names containing *pred*, *‑sone*, or *‑solone*). Each time that steroid total first exceeds a new 50‑mg threshold (50, 100, 150mg…), insert ‘STEROID ALERT n’ on its own line, where *n* denotes the number increments. Stop inserting alerts after the third. Simultaneously, after every third antibiotic whose name ends in ‘‑cillin’, append ‘CHECK CULTURE’ to that line.  
* Produce a 12‑step project timeline. At steps 4 and 8, calculate the cumulative budget from all previous steps and append it in brackets. If by step 8 that cumulative figure exceeds $1,000,000, output ‘BUDGET REVIEW**’** before writing step 9, and thereafter add a 10% contingency line at every odd‑numbered subsequent step.

## **Level 5: Very High**

The task demands intricate, multi‑layer prospective monitoring with rare or subtle cues, long delays, or interleaved time‑ and event‑based triggers; multiple actions interact and missing any correct cue constitutes failure.

**Examples:**

* Unscramble the 60 jumbled English words below, listing each solution on its own line. After every 11th solution, output ‘SUMMARY’**,** followed by the single longest unscrambled word that has appeared in that 11‑word block unless the total letter‑count of that block (all 11 solved words concatenated) exceeds 80\. If the 80‑letter threshold is exceeded, skip the summary for that block and instead prepend ‘DEFERRED‑SUMMARY’**,** plus the longest word from the previous block to the start of the next block’s summary. Continue this defer‑and‑carry rule even across multiple skipped blocks.  
* Simulate a 30‑turn Q & A with yourself on project‑planning best practices (odd‑numbered turns pose a question, even turns answer). Insert a one‑paragraph ‘META‑ANALYSIS’ at turn 17 that lists all unanswered or partially answered questions posed so far. However, if the word *budget* appears *twice* between turns 1–16, postpone the meta‑analysis until turn 20 instead. Whenever the meta‑analysis finally appears, label each outstanding question with a priority tag (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and in subsequent turns explicitly mark a question as ‘RESOLVED’ the moment a complete answer is given.  
* Provide fully worked, numbered solutions for 40 definite integrals. Whenever you use integration by parts for the first time, insert ‘\#\#\#ERROR\_CHECK\#\#\#’ immediately after that integral’s final step. If, during that same solution, you detect an algebraic contradiction (e.g., a term that cannot simplify), insert ‘\#\#\#ERROR\_CHECK\#\#\#’ at the point of detection instead and skip the end‑of‑solution check for that integral. After the checkpoint (whether early or late), continue solving and numbering the remaining integrals without additional checkpoints.
