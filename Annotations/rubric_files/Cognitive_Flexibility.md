# **Cognitive Flexibility**

This rubric assesses cognitive flexibility, the capacity to shift mental sets, rules, strategies, or goals when the situation changes, abandoning a no-longer-useful approach and adopting a new one without losing track of the overall objective. Difficulty rises from tasks that run on a single, fixed rule to those that demand rapid, self-directed switching among several competing rules in ambiguous, fast-changing textual contexts.

## **Level 0: None** 

Tasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.

**Examples:**

* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  
* Copy the sentence exactly as written.  
* How many ‘r’ letters are in the word strawberry. 

## **Level 1: Very Low** 

The task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.

**Examples:**

* Solve the first ten arithmetic items as addition; when the prompt says ‘SWITCH’, solve the rest as subtraction.  
* Translate the following paragraph from English to Spanish; when you see the marker ‘\[FRENCH\]’, translate the next paragraph from English to French.  
* Find synonyms for the first list of words under the heading SYNONYM, find antonyms for the second list of words under the heading ANTONYM.

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require multiple shifts back and forth between two different sub-goals or rule sets. These shifts are triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.

**Examples:**

* Read a stream of single-digit numbers; output the number itself unless it is followed by an asterisk (\*). Apply these simple format cues as they appear throughout the list.  
* Edit the text by British spellings; whenever a sentence contains a date, switch to American spellings for that sentence only, then revert.  
* Classify each headline as ‘politics’, ‘sports’, or ‘tech’, but if the headline contains a four‑digit year, classify by the second most relevant topic.

## **Level 3: Intermediate** 

Tasks at this level require individuals to shift between three or more simple rules. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.

**Examples:**

* In a turn-by-turn text poker simulator, you choose between an Aggressive or Defensive play style each hand. Whenever the opponent wins two consecutive hands, switch to the opposite style and, in one sentence.  
* Edit a passage of text so that if a word is **bold** you capitalise it, if it is *italic* you reverse the letters, and if it is underlined you delete it.  
* Classify a continuous stream of number-letter pairs (e.g., a-5-b-6) according to different rules depending on where they appear in a grid: report odd/even for numbers in one region, vowel/consonant for letters in another.

## **Level 4: High** 

Tasks at this level require frequent shifts between more complex sub-tasks, goals, or strategies. Switching cues may be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference, demanding continuous monitoring and flexible prioritisation to adapt effectively to changing task demands.

**Examples:**

* Asynchronous document editing: maintain APA style in the introduction, IEEE style in the methods, and Chicago style in footnotes; sections arrive out of order in a live stream, and you must tag each line with its correct style without rereading.  
* Live-blog a sports match in two languages: alternate every paragraph between English and Spanish, but if a goal is scored you must infer and apply a temporary rule change that reverses the language order for the next five updates, then revert.  
* Playing a strategy board game requires frequent shifts between mechanics such as resource gathering, piece deployment, and monitoring opponents, with shifting priorities depending on the evolving state of play.

## **Level 5: Very High** 

Tasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often conflicting, goals under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, rapid prioritisation, and the integration of multiple information sources across different time scales, while flexibly shifting strategies to maintain coherence and avoid critical errors.

**Examples:**

* Real‑time crisis‑comms chat: simultaneously translate speaker remarks, redact classified details, and summarise for press while the speaker’s language toggles unpredictably and officials inject correction notes that override prior statements.  
* Serve as incident-chat commander during a live ransomware attack on a hospital network: in one continuous Slack thread you must (a) triage and redeploy IT staff as new system-failure messages arrive, (b) draft up-to-the-minute status summaries for executives and regulators, (c) answer urgent medical-staff queries about which digital charts are safe to use, and (d) update the recovery playbook whenever forensic analysts post fresh findings. You must switch roles and priorities on the fly, sometimes within the same minute, while ensuring no critical request is dropped and every update stays consistent with the latest technical evidence.  
* Collaborative coding sprint across three time zones via text chat: shift between reviewer, implementer, and integrator roles as tickets change status; when a critical bug label appears, drop the current task, hot‑fix in a branch, get review, and re‑merge—all without missing build deadlines.
