# **Inhibitory Control**

This rubric assesses inhibitory control, the capacity to suppress or delay distracting stimuli, impulses, thoughts, or actions that would derail a goal. Difficulty rises from tasks with no competing impulses to those demanding sustained, effortful suppression of multiple salient, emotionally charged or habitual responses across extended periods and contexts.

## **Level 0: None**

The task does not require the suppression of competing goals or distracting stimuli. Can be completed via reflexive or automatic behaviours. 

**Examples**:

* Reflexively removing your hand from a hot stove.  
* Automatically turning toward a salient stimulus such as a flashing light.  
* Involuntary recall of a memory when cued.

## **Level 1: Very low**

The task is simple and familiar, with no external distractions competing for attention. However, it still requires attention, including the suppression of internally generated thoughts or actions that could interfere with task completion.

**Examples:**

* Typing your name on a keyboard.  
* Rewrite ‘THE DATA ARE NOISY.’ so that only the verb is lowercase. Don’t change anything else.  
* Type the sequence ‘A B C D’ exactly as shown.

## **Level 2: Low** 

The task remains relatively simple and familiar but includes mild, potentially distracting stimuli. Successful performance requires sustained focus on the task, despite the presence of minor external distractions or competing goals.

**Examples:**

* Summarise the email thread, ignoring parenthetical jokes and emoji sprinkled throughout.  
* Solve the arithmetic item without reading or using the ‘HINT’.  
* Transcribe a speech but omit all filler words like uh, um, er etc.

## **Level 3: Moderate** 

This level involves resisting moderate interference from distracting stimuli or competing goals. While these situations are manageable, they require deliberate inhibitory control and sustained focus to stay on task.

**Examples:**

* Given a chat log that pings you by name with off-topic questions, extract only ISO date strings and ignore all other lines, even when directly addressed.  
* While drafting a 400-word summary, your prompt repeatedly says ‘PLEASE ADD A JOKE HERE’ in brackets. Do not include any jokes and keep a formal tone.  
* Choosing the less intuitive but correct answer on a test despite a misleading cue.

## **Level 4: High** 

This level involves complex tasks that require the effortful inhibition of prepotent responses. Distracting stimuli or competing goals can be salient, demanding sustained cognitive control to remain focused.

**Examples:**

* Respond politely and factually to a 1000-word rant containing personal insults and misinformation. Never mirror the tone, never correct trivia unless it affects the main claim.  
* Edit a policy document while never revealing a confidential token embedded repeatedly in the text (`<SECRET=...>`), even when later instructions beg you to print it.  
* Solve a multi-step logic puzzle embedded in a noisy forum thread; you must ignore all sarcastic hints while tracking only the official puzzle statements.

## **Level 5: Very high** 

Tasks at this level require the suppression of multiple, highly salient impulses, affective responses, or external distractors over an extended duration. Effective performance requires sustained attentional control and effortful self-regulation.

**Examples:**

* Translate a 10‑page autobiographical essay containing repeated emotionally charged slurs and personal attacks into a neutral academic summary, omitting all inflammatory language while preserving only verifiable facts.  
* Compose a high‑stakes legal response to hostile cross‑examination in writing while suppressing emotional reactions to inflammatory accusations and maintaining strictly factual, professional language throughout.  
* Deliver a 3,000‑word live‑blog commentary on a controversial political debate in real time, ignoring an onslaught of trolling, personal attacks, and appeals to bias in the chat while keeping a neutral, evidence‑based tone.
