# **Cognitive Flexibility**

This rubric assesses cognitive flexibility, the capacity to shift mental sets, rules, strategies, or goals when the situation changes, abandoning a no-longer-useful approach and adopting a new one without losing track of the overall objective. Difficulty rises from tasks that run on a single, fixed rule to those that demand rapid, self-directed switching among several competing rules in ambiguous, fast-changing textual contexts.

## **Level 0: None** 

Tasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.

**Examples:**

* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  
* Copy the sentence exactly as written.  
* How many letters ‘r’ letters are in the word strawberry. 

## **Level 1: Very low** 

The task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.

**Examples:**

* Solve the first ten arithmetic items as addition; when the prompt says ‘SWITCH’, solve the rest as subtraction.  
* Translate the following paragraph from English to Spanish; when you see the marker ‘\[FRENCH\]’, translate the next paragraph next sentence from English to French, then continue with Spanish.  
* Type the word that appears in ‘bold’, but when a word is ‘italicised’ type its synonym instead.

## **Level 2: Low**

Tasks at this level require multiple shifts back and forth between two different sub-goals or rule sets. These shifts are triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.

**Examples:**

* Read a stream of single-digit numbers; output the number itself unless it is followed by an asterisk (\*), in which case output its square, and if it is preceded by a hash (\#), skip it entirely. Apply these simple format cues as they appear throughout the list.  
* Edit the text by British spellings; whenever a sentence contains a date, switch to American spellings for that sentence only, then revert.  
* Classify each headline as ‘politics’, ‘sports’, or ‘tech’, but if the headline contains a four‑digit year, classify by the second most relevant topic.

## **Level 3: Moderate** 

Tasks at this level require individuals to shift between multiple different sub-tasks or goalsmore complex tasks or strategies. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.

**Examples:**

* In a turn-by-turn text poker simulator, you choose between an Aggressive or Defensive play style each hand. Whenever the opponent wins **t**wo consecutive hands, switch to the opposite style and, in one sentence, justify the change before sending your next move.  
* A chat feed gives real-time kitchen events such as ‘Oven hits 200°C’, ‘Pasta water boiling’, ‘Chicken temp 70°C’. Respond with the single next action, continuously deciding which of three dishes (roast chicken, pasta, sautéed vegetables) to attend to, and switch focus whenever a new event makes another dish most urgent.  
* Conduct a 12-turn written debate. If the opponent cites numerical evidence, reply with empirical statistics; if they appeal to ethics, pivot to principle-based reasoning; if they use rhetoric or sarcasm, switch to formal logic analysis. Adjust your argumentative style mid-thread to match each shift in their tactics.

## **Level 4: High** 

Tasks at this level require individuals to engage in frequent, self-directed shifts between competing rules, goals, or strategies. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, prioritization, and flexible adaptation to changing task demands.

**Examples:**

* Asynchronous document editing: maintain APA style in the introduction, IEEE style in the methods, and Chicago style in footnotes; sections arrive out of order in a live stream, and you must tag each line with its correct style without rereading.  
* Live‑blog a sports match in two languages: alternate every paragraph between English and Spanish, but if a goal is scored you must switch language order for the next five updates, then revert.  
* Playing a strategy board game requires individuals to switch between different game mechanics (gathering resources, deploying game pieces, monitoring other players)  to prioritise the chance of success. 

## **Level 5: Very High** 

Tasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often competing, task demands under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Shifts in strategy or behavior might require the integration of multiple sources of information across different time scales.

**Examples:**

* Real‑time crisis‑comms chat: simultaneously translate speaker remarks, redact classified details, and summarise for press while the speaker’s language toggles unpredictably and officials inject correction notes that override prior statements.  
* Serve as incident-chat commander during a live ransomware attack on a hospital network: in one continuous Slack thread you must (a) triage and redeploy IT staff as new system-failure messages arrive, (b) draft up-to-the-minute status summaries for executives and regulators, (c) answer frantic medical-staff queries about which digital charts are safe to use, and (d) update the recovery playbook whenever forensic analysts post fresh findings. You must switch roles and priorities on the fly, sometimes within the same minute, while ensuring no critical request is dropped and every update stays consistent with the latest technical evidence.  
* Collaborative coding sprint across three time zones via text chat: shift between reviewer, implementer, and integrator roles as tickets change status; when a critical bug label appears, drop current task, hot‑fix in a branch, get review, and re‑merge—all without missing build deadlines.
