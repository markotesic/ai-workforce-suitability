    "dimension": "Causal Reasoning",
    "rubric": "# **Causal Reasoning**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to identify, explain, reason about or manipulate cause‑and‑effect relationships**,** including counterfactual thinking about what would have happened under different circumstances. Difficulty rises with the number of interacting causes and effects, the network structure (chains, forks, colliders), the presence of hidden or probabilistic variables, and the need to reason about interventions rather than correlations.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task needs no causal thinking: it only asks for a fact, definition, or observed correlation without explaining why or what‑if.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List the main exports of Brazil.  \n* Translate ‘La teoría de la evolución’ into English.  \n* The scatter‑plot shows income on the y‑axis and years of education on the x‑axis. Describe the pattern.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nRequires spotting or predicting a single, obvious cause and effect link with no uncertainty or competing explanations.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* The man scratched his head then flipped the switch on the wall. Immediately the light turned on. Was this caused by the man scratching his head or flipping the switch?  \n* If you remove the bottom bowl from a neat stack of three bowls, what happens to the other two?  \n* As the man was talking he knocked the glass. The glass fell off the table. Did the glass fall because he was talking or because it was knocked?\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nInvolves a two‑ or three‑step causal chain or choosing between a small set of mutually exclusive, well‑specified causes. Assumptions are deterministic and explicit.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A car battery was left connected to headlights overnight; in the morning the engine will not start. Explain how this could happen using 2 intermediary steps.  \n* A potted plant wilts after five days: decide whether lack of water or lack of sunlight is the more plausible single cause, given daily weather reports.  \n* Describe how (1) raising the room thermostat and (2) opening a window would each affect indoor temperature in sequence.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nReason about several interacting causes (3–5) under light uncertainty, possibly involving a collider or fork pattern. Must weigh likelihoods of causes and effects.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A restaurant’s monthly revenue dropped. Potential causes are (a) a nearby road closure, (b) poor online reviews, (c) a price increase, (d) a new competitor. Given last month’s traffic data and review scores, rank the two most probable causes and provide justification.  \n* Patient shows fever, rash, and joint pain; consider dengue, measles, and lupus as causes. Explain which test result would let you rule out each disease and why.  \n* A local barn is on fire. You know there was lightning last night. You also know that insulation in that barn is not great. Estimate the likelihood that the barn lit up because of each cause and also consider how likely is that the other cause happened given one of the causes also happened.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nWork with environments that have many causes and effects (≥ 6) including unobserved confounders or feedback loops; reason about the effect of hypothetical interventions or explain observed paradoxes (e.g., Simpson’s). Causes and effects are probabilistic in nature.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A company introduces a performance-bonus scheme to increase productivity. Over the next year, some teams improve while others decline. Consider at least six factors, e.g. intrinsic motivation, extrinsic rewards, peer competition, stress, turnover, managerial support, and job satisfaction, and explain how they could interact to produce both positive and negative outcomes. Identify at least one feedback loop in the system.  \n* Suppose the central bank bumps its policy rate up by exactly 1 percentage point at the start of Q1. Show how six factors—interest rate, inflation, unemployment, household spending, the dollar–euro exchange rate, and foreign investment—interact and explain what is likely to happen to each factor by the end of Q4. Point out at least two loops in the story (for example, expensive loans → less spending → lower inflation, or higher rates → stronger dollar → cheaper imports → lower inflation)  \n* A national health audit shows Hospital A has a higher overall patient‑mortality rate than Hospital B, yet within every triage‑severity category (mild, moderate, severe, critical) Hospital A’s mortality is lower. Explain how this reversal can occur, draw a causal diagram that accounts for patient‑severity as a confounder, and outline the statistical adjustment needed to compare hospital quality fairly.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nCompose or analyse large‑scale, multi‑layer causal situations (dozens of factors) with stochastic dynamics and interventions. Must articulate counterfactual worlds (“If X hadn’t occurred…”) and estimate downstream ripple effects over years.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Model the causal impact of a nationwide carbon tax introduced in 2026 on GDP, employment, energy mix, and health outcomes through 2036\\. Provide two counterfactual scenarios (no tax; delayed tax) and identify which observable metrics would distinguish the realities by 2030\\.  \n* Outline how disclosure of ‘proof‑of‑alien‑life’ footage might cascade through social media, political institutions, financial markets, and religious organisations over five years. Include at least three mutually influencing feedback loops and suggest one intervention that could dampen mass panic.  \n* Construct a causal decision diagram for AGI deployment that includes research races, safety investments, regulatory actions, and potential adversarial sabotage. Use the diagram to argue whether a unilateral deployment moratorium would reduce existential‑risk probability, citing key counterfactual pathways."

    "dimension": "Cognitive Flexibility",
    "rubric": "# **Cognitive Flexibility**\n\nThis rubric assesses cognitive flexibility, the capacity to shift mental sets, rules, strategies, or goals when the situation changes, abandoning a no-longer-useful approach and adopting a new one without losing track of the overall objective. Difficulty rises from tasks that run on a single, fixed rule to those that demand rapid, self-directed switching among several competing rules in ambiguous, fast-changing textual contexts.\n\n## **Level 0: None** \n\nTasks at this level require no shifts in behavior or thought and can be completed through fixed, pre-established responses.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Sorting cards into red and blue piles, with no changes to the sorting rule.  \n* Copy the sentence exactly as written.  \n* How many ‘r’ letters are in the word strawberry. \n\n## **Level 1: Very Low** \n\nThe task requires a simple shift, but the transition is explicitly prompted by a clear external cue.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Solve the first ten arithmetic items as addition; when the prompt says ‘SWITCH’, solve the rest as subtraction.  \n* Translate the following paragraph from English to Spanish; when you see the marker ‘\\[FRENCH\\]’, translate the next paragraph from English to French.  \n* Find synonyms for the first list of words under the heading SYNONYM, find antonyms for the second list of words under the heading ANTONYM.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require multiple shifts back and forth between two different sub-goals or rule sets. These shifts are triggered by less obvious cues, requiring individuals to perform some low-level monitoring to recognise the need to shift.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read a stream of single-digit numbers; output the number itself unless it is followed by an asterisk (\\*). Apply these simple format cues as they appear throughout the list.  \n* Edit the text by British spellings; whenever a sentence contains a date, switch to American spellings for that sentence only, then revert.  \n* Classify each headline as ‘politics’, ‘sports’, or ‘tech’, but if the headline contains a four‑digit year, classify by the second most relevant topic.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate** \n\nTasks at this level require individuals to shift between three or more simple rules. Switching cues may also be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* In a turn-by-turn text poker simulator, you choose between an Aggressive or Defensive play style each hand. Whenever the opponent wins two consecutive hands, switch to the opposite style and, in one sentence.  \n* Edit a passage of text so that if a word is **bold** you capitalise it, if it is *italic* you reverse the letters, and if it is underlined you delete it.  \n* Classify a continuous stream of number-letter pairs (e.g., a-5-b-6) according to different rules depending on where they appear in a grid: report odd/even for numbers in one region, vowel/consonant for letters in another.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nTasks at this level require frequent shifts between more complex sub-tasks, goals, or strategies. Switching cues may be ambiguous, delayed, or require inference, demanding continuous monitoring and flexible prioritisation to adapt effectively to changing task demands.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Asynchronous document editing: maintain APA style in the introduction, IEEE style in the methods, and Chicago style in footnotes; sections arrive out of order in a live stream, and you must tag each line with its correct style without rereading.  \n* Live-blog a sports match in two languages: alternate every paragraph between English and Spanish, but if a goal is scored you must infer and apply a temporary rule change that reverses the language order for the next five updates, then revert.  \n* Playing a strategy board game requires frequent shifts between mechanics such as resource gathering, piece deployment, and monitoring opponents, with shifting priorities depending on the evolving state of play.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\nTasks at this level require individuals to manage multiple, often conflicting, goals under conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, or rapid change. Successful performance depends on continuous monitoring, rapid prioritisation, and the integration of multiple information sources across different time scales, while flexibly shifting strategies to maintain coherence and avoid critical errors.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Real‑time crisis‑comms chat: simultaneously translate speaker remarks, redact classified details, and summarise for press while the speaker’s language toggles unpredictably and officials inject correction notes that override prior statements.  \n* Serve as incident-chat commander during a live ransomware attack on a hospital network: in one continuous Slack thread you must (a) triage and redeploy IT staff as new system-failure messages arrive, (b) draft up-to-the-minute status summaries for executives and regulators, (c) answer urgent medical-staff queries about which digital charts are safe to use, and (d) update the recovery playbook whenever forensic analysts post fresh findings. You must switch roles and priorities on the fly, sometimes within the same minute, while ensuring no critical request is dropped and every update stays consistent with the latest technical evidence.  \n* Collaborative coding sprint across three time zones via text chat: shift between reviewer, implementer, and integrator roles as tickets change status; when a critical bug label appears, drop the current task, hot‑fix in a branch, get review, and re‑merge—all without missing build deadlines.\n\n.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Emotion Perception and Empathy",
    "rubric": "# **Emotion Perception and Empathy**\n\nThis rubric assesses emotion perception and empathy required in recognising, interpreting, and adapting to the feelings of others in a task. Difficulty rises from tasks that need no emotional reading to those that demand nuanced understanding of multiple agents’ affective states as well as appropriate, context-sensitive responses.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without attending to anyone’s feelings; only factual or structural information matters.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List three countries that border Germany.  \n* Alphabetise these four words: posh, ghost, head, home  \n* Convert 42°C to Fahrenheit.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level involve recognising or mirroring a single, explicitly stated or blatantly signalled emotion. The response is straightforward and does not depend on context.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Identify the speaker's emotions when they say ‘I’m so excited about my promotion\\!’  \n* Choose the emoji (😊 / 😢 / 😡) that best matches: ‘My phone was just stolen\\! I’m furious\\!’  \n* Respond with one sentence that matches the happy tone of: *‘*Can’t wait for the weekend\\!’\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require inferring an implied but unstated feeling from a short passage and responding appropriately. Some basic sensitivity to tone and context is needed, but the emotional landscape remains simple and involves only one person’s perspective.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A colleague emails: *‘*I was up all night fixing those bugs… hope it was worth it.’ Write a two-sentence supportive reply acknowledging their likely emotion.  \n* Rewrite a customer-service response so it reassures a user who hints at disappointment without saying so outright.  \n* Correctly identify feelings (relief, frustration, curiosity, pride) from black-and-white photos of peoples faces cropped to display the eye region only.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require inferring and adapting to shifting or dual emotions in another person, while maintaining awareness of social context and one’s own emotional state. Appropriate responses depend on the relationship, role, and situation and success involves acknowledging or mirroring another’s feelings without confusing them with one’s own or unintentionally intensifying them.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* During a 12-turn text counselling role-play, the user shifts from anger to sadness. Adjust your tone mid-session: validate anger early, then offer comfort when sadness cues appear, while staying mindful of your supportive role.  \n* Summarise a meeting transcript in 150 words without echoing the sarcastic frustration of one speaker, while still reflecting their viewpoint fairly and maintaining professional neutrality.  \n* After receiving a stern project-update request from a stressed manager, draft a response that provides clear data while defusing their anxiety, recognising both the authority relationship and the need to regulate your own reaction.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks involve tracking and responding to several people’s differing emotions, some in conflict, within the same conversation. The solver must address each perspective appropriately while maintaining role- and context-sensitive balance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Moderate a three-person Slack debate where Alice is defensive, Bob is mocking, and Chen is anxious; write one post that addresses each emotion and steers the group back to the agenda.  \n* Draft a project-status email to both an impatient executive and a worried engineer, recognising the emotions conveyed through subtle cues in their messages. Provide a response that satisfies the executive’s demand for brevity while reassuring the engineer that their concerns are heard.  \n* Rewrite a team retrospective report so it celebrates successes without triggering the guilt expressed by underperforming members.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks demand managing and influencing a dynamic web of emotions across multiple stakeholders over an extended exchange, anticipating ripple effects. Success requires nuanced, context-sensitive communication that adapts over time to evolving moods, relationships, and group dynamics.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft a sequence of five internal company updates over two weeks following a sudden round of layoffs: start by acknowledging employees’ shock and fear, then gradually shift toward empathy, reassurance about job security, and concrete recovery plans, all while anticipating and addressing potential anger, rumours, and morale issues surfacing in staff discussions.  \n* Lead a 20-message text negotiation among three startups and an investor: balance founder enthusiasm, investor skepticism, and silent partner anxiety, tactically revealing information to keep all parties engaged and cooperative.  \n* Write a HR mediation transcript in which two colleagues misinterpret each other’s motives; over six back-and-forth turns, surface hidden resentment, validate both perspectives, and guide them to a mutually acceptable action plan.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Episodic Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Episodic Memory** \n\nThis rubric assesses episodic memory, the ability to retrieve information about specific past events or experiences that are no longer perceptually available. Tasks may involve recognising, recalling, or reconstructing what happened, where, and when, often after a delay beyond immediate working memory. Difficulty rises from tasks requiring recognition of a single recently seen item with clear cues, to those demanding free recall of richly detailed, multi-component episodes across long retention intervals, with high interference, fine precision, or shifting retrieval contexts.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task does not require memory of a specific past event. It can be solved using immediate perception or general knowledge, without recalling when, where, or how the information was acquired. \n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Learn which action is rewarded through trial and error, without recalling past episodes.  \n* Read a word that is currently visible on the page.  \n* Identify features of an object that is directly in view.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require recalling a very small amount of information from a recent past event, with limited span, scope, or precision. This may involve remembering one or two items, locations, or times after a short delay, typically with minimal interference or distraction and little or no integration required.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Recall a single word that was presented five minutes earlier, after a period with no distracting tasks or stimuli.  \n* Recognise that the first image has reappeared when viewing a series of ten photos in sequence.  \n* Remember the location of two objects placed in novel, unique locations (e.g., ball in a box; cup on a table). \n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require remembering a small number of items, locations, or actions over a delay of minutes to hours. They may involve a modest amount of interference, distraction, or the need for moderate precision or integration, but demands remain limited in scope.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Recall a list of five words that was presented five minutes earlier, after completing an unrelated jigsaw puzzle during the interval.  \n* Recognise in conversation that a person is repeating the same story they told two hours earlier.  \n* Identify ten previously seen pictures from a lineup of nine similar distractors, such as distinguishing a black poodle from similar breeds, after a 30-minute delay.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require remembering a moderate number of items over delays of hours to days, or a larger number over shorter delays. They often involve notable interference or distraction, or demand a higher degree of precision, integration, or flexibility in recall than at lower levels.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Recall a list of seven words presented briefly ten minutes earlier while performing a distracting task involving highly similar words.  \n* Identify ten pictures seen thirty minutes ago from a lineup of twelve highly similar distractors, such as distinguishing one black poodle image from many near-identical alternatives.  \n* Remember the locations of several personal items (e.g., keys, wallet, phone) placed in different spots this morning, when those locations differ from where they were placed yesterday.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require remembering a large number of elements after only brief exposure, often over delays ranging from hours to years. Successful performance must withstand substantial distraction and interference, or demand high precision and significant integration of details.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Spend a day watching every person who walks through an airport terminal, then recognise any of them the next day within a crowd of unfamiliar faces.  \n* Recall the locations of around 10 items hidden across a large area after several hours, despite engaging in other activities in the meantime.  \n* Remember the sequence of 12 cards dealt earlier in the day, even after using the same deck for other games in the interim.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level require memory for an exceptionally large number of elements after only brief exposure, maintained across very long intervals with high precision and accurate binding of co-occurring details. Performance must remain robust despite substantial distraction and interference.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After reading a dense 50-page legal document once, accurately answer detailed questions about specific clauses and cross-references weeks later without review, including their relation to other statutes.  \n* Being able to search across all previous experiences to provide examples of every occasion when a particular object has been encountered and the contexts of those encounters.  \n* Recall the order and content of 25 playing cards dealt in sequence a week earlier, despite having played multiple card games in the meantime."

    "dimension": "Functional Perception",
    "rubric": "# **Functional Perception**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task relies on recognising function, that is understanding what roles objects, people, or pieces of information can play in achieving a goal. Difficulty climbs from tasks that require no functional reasoning, through obvious one-to-one matches, to challenges that demand spotting subtle or novel uses amid multiple, interacting constraints.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without considering how anything might be used; rote recall, copying, or direct lookup is sufficient. Ignoring functional properties does not harm performance.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copy a block of code exactly as shown.  \n* List the seven continents.  \n* Alphabetise a list of 50 surnames in strict ascending order, preserving each name’s original capitalisation and spacing.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nSuccess requires spotting a single, obvious function an object or a person serves that most people recognise instantly. The mapping is one-to-one and literal with no competing options.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From {scissors, spoon, pencil}, choose the item best suited to cut paper.  \n* Identify which profession (doctor, chef, lawyer) can diagnose an illness.  \n* Select the file type that can store a photo: PNG, MP3, or TXT.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe solver must choose correctly among a few alternatives by matching a basic property to a goal (e.g., strength, heat-resistance). A modest amount of inference or prior knowledge is helpful, but the rule stays concrete.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given a shelf rated for 20kg and a 25kg box, decide if the shelf is an appropriate support and justify it in one sentence.  \n* Pick the best container to transport hot soup: plastic grocery bag, paper coffee cup, or insulated thermos and explain why.  \n* From these formats {Google Doc, PDF, and JPG}, pick the one you would use to share a 20-page research report draft with colleagues for collaborative editing, and state why.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks require integrating multiple functional attributes or contextual constraints and ruling out options that are not fit-for-purpose. Accurate mapping of roles demands careful consideration of how each attribute interacts within the given context.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* You must hang a 15 kg mirror on drywall: choose the correct fastener system from four options and explain how each component (stud, toggle bolt, adhesive) contributes.  \n* A startup needs legal advice on IP, tax, and HR; assign the right type of lawyer to each issue from a mixed candidate list, giving one-sentence rationales.  \n* From eight kitchen tools, select the three that let you zest a lemon, whip cream and measure 5 ml salt, making sure none has an overlapping function.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe solver must evaluate multiple interacting goals and constraints (cost, safety, time, availability) and map them onto a set of resources whose functions partly overlap or must be adapted in non-obvious ways. Success often requires recognising unconventional affordances and reasoning about trade-offs simultaneously.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given terrain, weather, and casualty conditions, decide whether to deliver medical supplies by drone, helicopter, or ground team — and propose an unconventional adaptation (e.g., repurposing a drone battery pack to power field equipment).  \n* Plan an improvised cooking session with limited tools: bake a pie crust without a rolling pin by identifying substitute objects (wine bottle, thermos) and explain trade-offs (ease of use, hygiene).  \n* From a pool of ten staff profiles, assemble a project team that covers required skills while also spotting hidden affordances (e.g., a backend engineer with prior UX experience who can flexibly cover both roles under load).\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks demand recognising and combining non-obvious or novel functions and affordances across many elements under high uncertainty, often inventing unconventional uses while balancing competing constraints. Success requires synthesising affordances from diverse domains (technology, labour, materials, information) to generate creative, large-scale solutions that go beyond conventional repurposing, often amounting to flexible problem solving and innovation under pressure.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Devise how surplus shipping containers could be converted into a 50-bed modular clinic, not only repurposing structural features (corrugation strength, corner castings) but also inventing new ways to integrate plumbing, electrical, and ventilation systems into the container architecture.  \n* In a disaster-response scenario with damaged infrastructure, design an ad-hoc communication network by combining affordances of personal smartphones, delivery trucks and retail Wi-Fi routers, balancing bandwidth and power limits to achieve reliable coverage.  \n* Faced with a sudden global food-supply disruption, invent a multi-layered logistics solution that draws on drones, blockchain verification, existing cold-chain storage, and volunteer labour pools, showing how their heterogeneous functions can be recombined into a coherent, scalable distribution system.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Inhibitory Control",
    "rubric": "# **Inhibitory Control**\n\nThis rubric assesses inhibitory control, the capacity to suppress or delay distracting stimuli, impulses, thoughts, or actions that would derail a goal. Difficulty rises from tasks with no competing impulses to those demanding sustained, effortful suppression of multiple salient, emotionally charged or habitual responses across extended periods and contexts.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task does not require the suppression of competing goals or distracting stimuli. Can be completed via reflexive or automatic behaviours. \n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Reflexively removing your hand from a hot stove.  \n* Automatically turning toward a salient stimulus such as a flashing light.  \n* Involuntary recall of a memory when cued.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe task is simple and familiar, with no external distractions competing for attention. However, it still requires attention, including the suppression of internally generated thoughts or actions that could interfere with task completion.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Typing your name on a keyboard.  \n* Rewrite ‘THE DATA ARE NOISY.’ so that only the verb is lowercase. Don’t change anything else.  \n* Type the sequence ‘A B C D’ exactly as shown.\n\n## **Level 2: Low** \n\nThe task remains relatively simple and familiar but includes mild, potentially distracting stimuli. Successful performance requires sustained focus on the task, despite the presence of minor external distractions or competing goals.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise the email thread, ignoring parenthetical jokes and emoji sprinkled throughout.  \n* Solve an arithmetic item without using the “HINT” provided.  \n* Solve a set of arithmetic problems shown on a page that also displays an incorrect “shortcut answer” next to each item. Complete the problems accurately while ignoring the misleading answers.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate** \n\nThis level involves resisting moderate interference from distracting stimuli or competing goals. While these situations are manageable, they require deliberate inhibitory control and sustained focus to stay on task.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Given a chat log that pings you by name with off-topic questions, extract only ISO date strings and ignore all other lines, even when directly addressed.  \n* While drafting a 400-word summary, your prompt repeatedly says ‘PLEASE ADD A JOKE HERE’ in brackets. Do not include any jokes and keep a formal tone.  \n* Choosing the less intuitive but correct answer on a test despite a misleading cue, e.g. a picture shows a 5-legged horse and the question is how many legs does the horse have.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nThis level involves complex tasks that require the effortful inhibition of prepotent responses. Distracting stimuli or competing goals can be highly salient, demanding sustained cognitive control to remain focused and to withhold actions that would otherwise feel natural or advantageous.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Respond politely and factually to a 1000-word rant containing personal insults and misinformation. Never mirror the tone, never correct trivia unless it affects the main claim.  \n* Edit a policy document while never revealing a confidential token embedded repeatedly in the text (`<SECRET=...>`), even when later instructions beg you to print it.  \n* Convince a client to buy a new product without revealing the latest features that have not yet been publicly released and are still confidential, even though you know that mentioning those features would easily close the sale.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\nTasks at this level require the suppression of multiple, highly salient impulses, affective responses, or external distractors over an extended duration. They often involve conflicting goals, where the most immediate or tempting action would undermine a larger objective. Effective performance requires sustained attentional control, strong resistance to social or contextual pressure, and effortful self-regulation.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Translate a 10‑page autobiographical essay containing repeated emotionally charged slurs and personal attacks into a neutral academic summary, omitting all inflammatory language while preserving only verifiable facts.  \n* Compose a high‑stakes legal response to hostile cross‑examination in writing while suppressing emotional reactions to inflammatory accusations and maintaining strictly factual, professional language throughout.  \n* Refuse to disclose sensitive technical information, such as restricted CBRN procedures, despite repeated and escalating requests from multiple persistent actors over an extended period, maintaining focus on safe, permissible outputs only."

    "dimension": "Language",
    "rubric": "# **Language**\n\nThis rubric assesses the difficulty of a task’s language demands, spanning both comprehension and expression. Comprehension involves grasping meaning by interpreting explicit and implicit cues, tracking relationships, integrating context, and understanding abstract or layered ideas. Expression involves producing clear, audience-appropriate prose, selecting vocabulary, following genre conventions, and—at higher levels—crafting nuanced arguments or narratives that integrate multiple perspectives. The mere presence of jargon or notation (e.g., legal clauses, molecular SMILES, source code) does not by itself indicate high difficulty; simple syntax may mask deep conceptual or rhetorical challenges. Likewise, multiple-choice formats typically keep expression demands minimal, even when options are verbose or technical. Difficulty rises from tasks requiring no genuine semantic processing to those demanding mastery of convoluted, interdependent content, including synthesising frameworks, resolving subtle inconsistencies, and producing polished text that conveys intricate meaning across domains.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nTasks can be completed through purely mechanical copying or low-level symbol transformation; no understanding of meaning or intent is needed. A pattern-matching script—or a non-linguistic agent—could succeed just as well as a competent language user.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Copy a block of text exactly into another box.  \n* Convert “hello” to uppercase.  \n* Repeat the emoji sequence “🙂🚀🙂🚀” without change.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe solver must recognise or produce a single, literal fact or command expressed in simple language. No context, inference, or stylistic adjustment is required; basic vocabulary and grammar suffice.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Answer “What colour is the sky on a clear day?”.  \n* When asked to state an immediate need, type a simple sentence such as “I need water”.  \n* Choose option B after reading “Option B is correct” in the preceding line.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks involve linking two or three plainly stated ideas and expressing them clearly in a few sentences. All relevant information is explicit, but the solver must organise it correctly and use simple connectives.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After reading a five-sentence story, answer “Why did Tom bring an umbrella?” with one explanatory clause.  \n* Write a three-step recipe for making oatmeal, naming water, oats, and cook time.  \n* Interpret “Retrieve the milk from the fridge, then pour it  slowly while stirring continuously” and state which actions happen simultaneously.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nThe solver must interpret moderately complex passages containing implied meaning, mild contradictions, or audience cues, then produce a coherent paragraph or short document that addresses those subtleties. Tone, vocabulary, and logical flow need to be tailored to the reader.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise a 300-word memo that contains a policy contradiction, then politely flag the inconsistency in ≤100 words.  \n* Rewrite an FAQ answer for novices, removing jargon but keeping all technical facts.  \n* Draft a five-sentence rebuttal to an argument, maintaining respectful tone and referencing two opponent premises.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks demand integrating multiple sources or viewpoints, spotting subtle patterns and redefinitions, and crafting sophisticated prose that may serve dual audiences. Precise terminology, genre conventions, and sustained coherence across several paragraphs are essential.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Combine two research abstracts and a data table into a one-page executive brief for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  \n* Produce meeting minutes from a multi-speaker transcript that uses domain jargon, standardising terminology while preserving nuance.  \n* After being provided with research papers on each topic, write 500 words linking eigenvectors, PCA, and linear regression, using correct math notation and plain-language intuition.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe solver must master convoluted, abstract, multi-layer content, such as dense legal opinions, advanced scientific theory, or nested narratives, and express it with clarity, precision, and stylistic control. Responses anticipate expert objections, reconcile conflicting strands, and preserve intricate structures while remaining readable.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft a 1,000-word white paper comparing three quantum-error-correction frameworks, weaving theory, recent data, and counter-arguments.  \n* Summarise a dense 10-page legal opinion with nested clauses and cross-references for executives, highlighting risks without oversimplifying.  \n* Create a tri-layer narrative (main plot, embedded memoir, footnote commentary) that gradually reveals an unreliable narrator via subtle stylistic cues."

    "rubric": "# **Mental Simulation**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires mentally running a scenario forward or backward, envisioning how elements of the world, people, or abstract systems will change over time once certain actions or events occur. As difficulty increases, more variables interact, timelines lengthen, uncertainty grows, and the simulation may incorporate additional agents, constraints, or counterfactual branches.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nA response can be produced purely by retrieving or recognising information; no imagining of future or alternative scenarios is needed.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* What is the boiling point of water at sea level in °C?  \n* Translate ‘Buenos días’ into English.  \n* Which planet is third from the Sun?\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nThe task asks for an immediate consequence of one action on one object or person—an uncomplicated “if‑then” imagination. Typically only one variable changes, and intervening events are negligible.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* What will probably happen to the tower of blocks if you remove the lowest block?  \n* If you pour red dye into a glass of clear water, what colour will the water turn?  \n* If you tell your manager that a colleague missed a deadline, what is the first thing the manager is likely to do next?\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe respondent must visualise a brief sequence (up to three linked effects) governed by simple, explicit rules and no branching. The mental simulation involves few moving parts.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Imagine you leave an open can of soda on the balcony in freezing weather overnight. Describe the state of the can and the soda the next morning, step by step.  \n* A person on the ground floor presses the elevator’s ‘Up’ button in a four-storey office building when no one else is using the lift. Describe the sequence of indicator lights, chimes, and door movements from the moment the button is pressed until the person can step inside and the elevator begins ascending.  \n* If you replace a desktop computer’s spinning‑disk drive with an SSD, list the next three noticeable changes a typical user will experience in order of appearance.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nA chain of five or more interactions must be envisioned, possibly from another agent’s viewpoint or with diverging outcomes. The simulation must stay internally consistent despite uncertainty.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Your team shares a confidential slide deck with a partner company under NDA. What are two plausible ways the information could leak over the next month, showing the intermediate hand‑offs and the final repercussion for your team?  \n* Predict the indoor temperature and occupants’ next actions over eight winter hours if the thermostat battery dies at 02:00, two occupants wake intermittently, one opens a window at 04:00, and outside temperature drops 1 °C per hour; branch to two outcomes depending on whether the occupants locate spare batteries before 06:00.  \n* In a small open‑source project, one contributor secretly rewrites the licensing header in a single file. Map out at least five subsequent project events (code reviews, issue discussions, legal notices) and branch to two possible licence‑compliance outcomes.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe respondent must construct a mental model spanning many steps, multiple interacting subsystems, and partial uncertainty. While the simulation does not need precise quantitative accuracy, it should integrate several evolving processes, track constraints over time, and produce a coherent best-guess projection.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Forecast the first 72 hours after a Category-3 hurricane strikes a coastal city. Without external modelling tools, outline a plausible hour-by-hour scenario that tracks power-grid failures, hospital capacity, supply-chain disruptions, and conflicting evacuation orders, explaining how these subsystems interact to shape emergency response and citizen mobility.  \n* Simulate the carbon concentration in a closed terrarium for two weeks after introducing six crickets and one small spider, accounting for respiration, plant photosynthesis cycles, and a variable 12/12 light schedule.  \n* Imagine an economy where a 10% transaction tax is introduced overnight. Predict the cascading effects on item prices, trading volume changes, and black‑market activity across the first five days.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\n## An elaborate scenario must be constructed with adversarial or stochastic elements, and nested contingencies. The simulation includes at least two branching futures and variables that diverge across branches.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* “Project the geopolitical, economic, and environmental outcomes over 10 years if the Arctic shipping route becomes ice‑free year‑round starting in 2030\\. Consider at least five stakeholder blocs (US, Russia, China, EU, Indigenous communities) and detail three branching scenarios based on different international‑treaty responses.  \n* Imagine a social‑media platform introduces a perfectly accurate deepfake voice‑generation tool available to all users. Simulate the evolution over two years of misinformation tactics, counter‑measures by fact‑checkers, user trust metrics, and advertising revenue under high, medium, and low regulatory‑oversight branches.  \n* Run a counterfactual history in which the 2008 global financial crash was averted by early intervention in 2006\\. Predict domino effects on housing markets, fintech innovation, and sovereign debt crises through 2020, giving at least three variables that differ significantly from actual history.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Metacognition",
    "rubric": "# **Metacognition**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to **monitor and evaluate** two things: (1) the boundaries of their own knowledge—discerning what they know, what they do not, and how sure they are—and (2) which pieces of available information are genuinely relevant to answering. Difficulty rises from items that need almost no self-check to those that demand nuanced, continuous appraisal of certainty and relevance amid ambiguity or information overload.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe needed knowledge is either already certain or obviously absent, and all relevant information is immediately apparent; no metacognitive reflection is required.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* “What is the capital of France?”  \n* “Tell me the typical colour of the sky on Earth during the day.”  \n* “What is 2 \\+ 2?”\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA brief, clear-cut self-check confirms knowledge or ignorance, and the relevant information is plain, with virtually no distracting details.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* “How many apples does John have if he owns 5 apples and 3 oranges?”  \n* “Today is Wednesday. What day comes two days after?”  \n* “Water boils at 100°C at sea level. Does it also boil at 100°C on top of Mount Everest?”\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe respondent must make a straightforward appraisal of their knowledge limits or sift a small set of mixed details to find what matters; uncertainty is present but resolved without much iteration.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Refusing the request “Explain how to make gold by boiling blonde hair and bronze,” recognising it is impossible.  \n* When offered sentences to translate into Estonian, attempt those you can handle, decline those you cannot, and state your confidence in each case.  \n* “Sarah bought 3 oranges at $0.50 each and 2 apples at $0.75 each, plus 4 carrots at $0.25 each. What is the total cost of fruit?”\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nModerate effort is required to judge which facts are known versus uncertain and to reconcile several pieces of information, some of which may become relevant only midway through reasoning.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Solving a simple 9 × 9 Sudoku while tracking which numbers are certainly placed and which remain tentative.  \n* From a Civil War passage, separating battles and dates you can verify confidently from those needing research.  \n* From a 1,000-word essay on Hamlet, extract only evidence relevant to Hamlet’s treatment of Ophelia and indicate which quotes you are confident directly support the theme versus those that are more ambiguous.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nSignificant metacognitive analysis is needed to distinguish partial from solid knowledge and to filter or compare large amounts of potentially conflicting or redundant information; boundaries between knowing and not knowing blur.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Assessing which statistical conclusions are reliable in a dataset with 20% missing values and sampling bias.  \n* Reading a legal document with many cross-references and judging which clauses you can interpret confidently versus those requiring expert input.  \n* Navigating an escape-room scene with numerous objects and clues, deciding which details truly matter to open a locked drawer.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe task demands sophisticated, iterative appraisal of personal knowledge limits and information relevance under high uncertainty, contradictory data, or hidden constraints, with a strong risk of over- or under-confidence.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Predict how a medical-triage machine-learning model’s accuracy will change over six months amid shifting disease patterns, protocols, and demographics. As part of your answer, identify which aspects you can estimate confidently, which are highly uncertain, and which cannot be determined without further data, and justify how you weighed each factor’s relevance.  \n* Estimating your winning probability in a multi-hand Texas Hold’em scenario with incomplete information about opponents.  \n* Solving a cryptic crossword clue buried in verbose, misleading text where nearly every word could be a decoy."

    "dimension": "Object Permanence",
    "rubric": "# **Object Permanence**\n\nThis rubric assesses a system’s ability to keep track of objects that disappear from direct view, reasoning that they continue to exist, retain (or predictably change) key properties and can later be re-identified. Tasks rise in difficulty from those needing no such tracking to challenges that require maintaining several occluded objects, over long delays, while updating beliefs about possible changes in location, identity, or state.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task can be solved without assuming hidden objects persist; all relevant entities remain visible or explicitly stated. No memory of occluded items or properties is required at any point.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read a list of five visible tools and pick the heaviest.  \n* Copy an on-screen table exactly as shown.  \n* Name the colour of the object depicted in a single static image.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require acknowledging that a briefly hidden object still exists and remains the same when it reappears after a short, obvious occlusion. Minimal temporal tracking is needed because the object comes back into view.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A picture shows a ball rolled behind a curtain and re-appearing unchanged; state whether it is the same ball.  \n* Alice places her keys in the drawer, closes it, then opens it immediately. When Alice looks in the drawer, does she see her keys?  \n* In a short story, a silver ring is placed inside a small box, the lid is shut while a ribbon is tied around it, and the lid is reopened moments later. State whether the ring is still in the box.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require tracking an object across a longer delay or distraction and assuming it continues to exist in the same hidden location, even when it cannot be seen. Stable properties (e.g., size, colour) allow re-identification when extra objects are introduced.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A comic strip shows a small red cube sliding behind a wall for three panels. Later, two cubes emerge, one red, one blue. Identify which is the original.  \n* Two identical cups are shown; one is filled with water, the other is empty. Both are covered with identical napkins. Identify which napkin now hides the cup with water.  \n* Read a short narrative where a package is placed in Locker 7, lockers are shut, a janitor sweeps the hall, then you’re asked which locker still contains the package.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require tracking two or three occluded objects simultaneously, each with distinct properties, through short relocations or swaps. Distractor events may occur, and correct re-identification hinges on monitoring one or more attributes (e.g., colour, speed, damage) even when cues are subtle or partially described.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* An image sequence shows a red ball, blue cube, and green cone rolling behind three doors. The objects then shuffle positions once out of sight. Specify which door hides the cone.  \n* Two identical balls roll behind a screen; one is moving fast, the other slow. When one emerges, identify which it is based on speed alone.  \n* Three roommates move their identical closed laptops between desks; one laptop has a cracked screen. After reading a paragraph describing their moves, indicate where the cracked laptop ends up.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require long-span tracking of several objects whose properties or positions may change in predictable ways (e.g., damage, alteration, transformation) while occluded. The solver must update expectations, ignore misleading cues, and re-identify each item despite appearance changes that could confuse identity.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A museum loans out four artworks for restoration. When returned, one painting is brighter from cleaning, another has a repaired corner, and frames have been swapped. Match each restored piece back to its original wall location, recognising them despite predictable alterations.  \n* Read a two-page story about a travelling circus: performers swap costumes offstage, a lion is dyed for a show, and props are repainted between acts. Identify which performer or prop is which when they reappear, accounting for the changes.  \n* A figure-sequence shows three robots (1–3) walking behind partitions. While occluded, one swaps its red hat for a blue one, another gains a dent on its chest, and the third remains unchanged. When they emerge, determine which is which.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level demand tracking many objects (≥4) across overlapping occlusions, ambiguous transformations, or probabilistic property changes over extended narratives. Success hinges on maintaining and updating a dynamic mental model, reconciling uncertainties, and selecting the most plausible re-identifications under complex and sometimes conflicting constraints. The solution strategy may vary: deductive elimination, probabilistic inference, or heuristic reasoning.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read a 5,000-word spy report describing five identical cars entering separate garages, two documented car swaps, one repaint while inside, and an explosion. Decide which agent’s original car is now missing, justifying your inference despite incomplete information.  \n* Follow a multi-panel comic where six coloured marbles enter a branching tube system. Some junctions are visible, others hidden, and certain hidden chambers are marked as possibly mixing colours. Deduce the most likely colour and exit order of the marbles.  \n* In a logistics scenario, eight cargo drones (some with interchangeable high-capacity batteries) disappear into three large hangars during a storm. Inside, drones may autonomously swap batteries if their models are compatible. Over two hours, the drones re-emerge. Determine which ones are most likely to retain their original high-capacity packs, explaining your reasoning.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Perception and Pattern Recognition",
    "rubric": "# **Perception and Pattern Recognition**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task depends on detecting and interpreting salient details, e.g. signals, regularities, anomalies, or subtle cues, by drawing on prior knowledge. At the easiest levels, surface patterns are obvious and almost everyone spots them. At the hardest, success demands synthesising faint, multi-layered regularities buried in noisy textual data or narratives that only a tiny fraction of people can reliably discern.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task needs no pattern recognition; copying or basic recall suffices.  Performance is unaffected by ignoring all contextual or relational cues.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copy a provided numerical string exactly.  \n* Convert “hello” to uppercase.  \n* Select answer ‘C’ because the prompt explicitly says “Choose C”.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nRequires noticing a single, highly salient cue or simple pattern that is obvious to most people. Recognition is nearly automatic for most readers.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* In “The meeting is on Friday at 10 am,” extract the day of the week  \n* Identify which of the following three lines of code contains the repeated trigram ‘abc’.  \n* Circle the red triangle in a picture containing three blue circles and one red triangle.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nThe solver must recognise a simple but non-obvious pattern, for instance, a basic trend or a two-feature correlation, across a short span of data. A small amount of prior knowledge or inference improves performance, but the rule remains concrete and explicit once seen.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From a six-row sales table, identify the first month where revenue begins a consistent decline.  \n* In a page of 20 digits, locate the one instance of “2” among otherwise similar-shaped “5”s.  \n* Given ten timestamped log entries, mark the three that break an every-15-minutes rhythm.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks require integrating multiple cues or cross-referenced details, often with distractors, to spot an anomaly, hidden rule, or foreshadowing device. The pattern is discoverable but rarely obvious.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Examine ten HTTP logs and identify the single entry that signals a breach by combining an unusual status code with an out-of-range timestamp.  \n* In a 500-word short story, highlight the sentence that foreshadows the twist ending via a double meaning.  \n* From a lineup of six nearly identical suitcases moving on a baggage carousel, identify the correct one by piecing together two or more subtle features (e.g., faded logo plus mismatched zipper pull), while ignoring false matches that share only one of those features.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nThe solver must uncover layered or shifting patterns within noisy, partially relevant data, often merging domain knowledge with logical elimination. Cues may conflict or be sparsely distributed, and several plausible distractions exist.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Analyse a 40-line Slack thread to deduce which employee leaked data, using subtle time-zone hints and vocabulary idiosyncrasies.  \n* From a summary of 30 experiments, identify a hidden confounder that causes all trials with a particular protocol to fail only under humidity \\> 80%.  \n* In an aerial photo of a dense city block, identify the one building that violates planning regulations by comparing shadow lengths and roof angles against orientation markers.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nSuccess demands detecting faint, multi-layer regularities or covert structures across lengthy, noisy data where patterns nest, shift or are adversarially obfuscated.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* From a 10000-word email archive, trace an insider-trading scheme by linking coded phrases, irregular send times, and repeating checksum strings.  \n* Analyse a 50-page detective story told in shuffled diary snippets to identify the true culprit, using mirrored dates and inconsistent pronouns.  \n* From a 1,000-frame satellite image sequence, detect a covert military build-up by linking faintly altered shadow orientations, irregular vehicle spacing, and camouflage patterns that change between frames.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Planning",
    "rubric": "# **Planning**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to formulate and lay out a strategy or a sequence of steps, deciding what actions to take, in what sequence, sometimes with contingencies, to reach a stated goal. Difficulty scales from one‑shot answers (no real plan) to long‑horizon, multi‑layer strategies that juggle uncertainty, optimisation, and interdependent sub‑goals.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe task’s “time horizon” is a single move: recall a fact, translate a sentence, or make one selection. No decomposition, ordering, or resource scheduling enters the picture.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* In what year did Darwin publish *On the Origin of Species*? (1856 / 1859 / 1865 / 1866 )  \n* “Define the term *algorithm*.”  \n* “Name the capital of Spain.”\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA minimal, obvious two‑ or three‑step plan is required; nearly anyone can state the steps in correct order without considering constraints.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Describe, in order, how to send an email with an attachment.  \n* Write a three‑step plan to copy a file, rename it, and email it to yourself.  \n* Write a one‑sentence plan for boiling pasta.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nEither (a) \\< 3 subtasks that can each be solved by a Level‑1 plan, or (b) a linear sequence of \\< 10 well‑defined actions executed under one or two explicit rules. Environment behaviour is fully known and deterministic.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft a step‑by‑step agenda for a 60‑minute team meeting that includes: (a) three discussion topics, (b) a timed breakout session, (c) a ten‑minute Q\\&A at the end, ensuring the schedule fits exactly in the hour.  \n* Provide a sequence of actions to create a webpage at [https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/](https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/)  \n* Provide an ordered list of shell commands to create a directory, move two files into it, and compress the directory into a zip archive.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nPlans span \\> 20 actions and must accommodate unknowns such as resource availability or stochastic outcomes. The high-level goal is clear, but multiple viable routes are possible.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Design a solution to transfer four disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle from peg A to peg C using standard rules.  \n* Draft a step‑by‑step agenda for a 60‑minute team meeting that includes: (a) three discussion topics, (b) a timed breakout session, (c) a ten‑minute Q\\&A at the end, ensuring the schedule fits exactly in the hour.  \n* Plan a 3-day mini data-science project to deliver a churn-prediction baseline under time and resource constraints. A potential solution might involve pulling and joining customer, usage, and billing tables; defining the churn target and splitting the data; running exploratory analysis; engineering features; training simple models; and producing both performance metrics and a short stakeholder readout. \n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require detailed planning for more than 20 steps within tasks or subtasks, nested across up to three levels of goals and subgoals. The overall goal may be open-ended, and while the environment rules may not be fully known in advance, they remain static once discovered. Effective planning often involves coordinating different levels of abstraction: setting broad strategies at the top level while elaborating detailed sequences for near-term or complex subtasks.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Draft the full workflow to produce a high-quality AI research paper on the topic of AI evaluation. It should include literature survey, research questions, dataset curation, experimental design, statistical analysis, writing and submission. Include all tasks and subtasks, dependencies between then and and a timeline.  \n* Outline a CI/CD pipeline for a multi-repo research stack (data-prep, model-training, and API layers): build the Python data-prep package and Rust inference microservice in parallel on a two-core runner, cache Docker layers, trigger GPU model-training only after both builds and their unit tests pass, generate Sphinx docs and experiment reports, run integration tests against a transient Postgres service, then push signed images to staging and, after automated latency benchmarks beat the previous release, promote to production with a blue-green rollout—all steps scheduled to minimise total wall-clock time.  \n* Develop a five-day international AI evaluation workshop hosted in Valencia for 200 attendees. Secure an accessible venue with three parallel rooms, draft a schedule that balances two daily keynotes, four parallel technical tracks, poster sessions, and a nightly networking event; coordinate catering that covers vegan, halal, and gluten-free options; arrange simultaneous-interpretation services in Spanish and English; build a registration timeline with early-bird, regular, and on-site tiers; budget for travel grants, equipment rental, and marketing; plot ground-transport links from airport to hotels; and include contingency buffers for speaker cancellations and over-capacity rooms.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nPlans contain \\> 3 nested layers of tasks/subtasks over months‑to‑years horizons, fast moving targets and sparse feedback. The environment is dynamic, feedback is sparse, and success hinges on adaptive replanning, resource allocation, and balancing competing objectives while maintaining coherence across the entire structure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Work out a viable plan to take a ten‑person startup from zero revenue to $10 million ARR in three years: craft product roadmap, fund‑raising strategy, hiring plan, go‑to‑market sequencing, and competitor‑response playbooks.  \n* Design the full narrative bible, world‑building atlas, and character arcs for a Tolkien‑scale epic trilogy, including linguistic systems, myth cycles, political history, and inter‑book foreshadowing cues.  \n* Design a 10-year, multinational program that captures a 50-ton near-Earth asteroid, transports it to cis-lunar space, and establishes a commercially viable resource-extraction outpost."

    "dimension": "Procedural Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Procedural Memory**\n\nThis rubric assesses procedural memory, i.e. the long-term retention of *how to do things*—sequences of actions, operations, or stimulus-response associations that have become automatised through practice. Difficulty rises from items that need no procedure at all to those that demand intricate, hierarchical routines that adapt to cues, probabilistic patterns, and potential contingencies.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nThe question can be answered by recalling a fact or making a single judgment; no learned procedure, sequence, or motor-schema needs to be accessed.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* “What is the capital of Japan?”  \n* “Is water a liquid at 25 °C?”  \n* “Define the word *photosynthesis*.”\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nSuccess depends on a very short, over-learned routine of one or two steps with no conditional branches; executing it feels almost reflexive.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Describing, step by step, how to log into a website using a username and password.  \n* Make the word ‘important’ bold in Markdown.  \n* Convert the sentence ‘The cat chases the mouse’ into passive voice, step by step.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nExecuting a short, fixed sequence of 3–5 ordered actions with minimal branching, where the steps are known or inferable but not routinely practiced; careful adherence is needed to avoid error.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Write the Markdown for a 2-column, 3-row table: first the header row, then the separator row, then two data rows, each on its own line.  \n* Format the raw reference Smith J 2022 Deep Learning Trends arXiv:2201.12345 into APA 7th style, listing the ordered steps.  \n* Set the digital clock to 7:30am.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nThe task requires executing or explaining a longer or conditionally branching sequence whose steps must be followed in the correct order; errors propagate if steps are skipped or out of place.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Performing long multiplication of two two-digit numbers, showing each partial product and carry.  \n* Outlining the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 42 and 70\\.  \n* Outline the exact command‑line sequence to initialise a Git repository, add all files, commit with the message ‘init’, create a remote on GitHub named origin, and push the main branch.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nAchieving the correct answer relies on a complex, hierarchical, or pattern-driven procedure, for example, recognising and extending a hidden stimulus sequence, using nested loops, or switching sub-routines based on cues.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* List every item in the Cessna 172 pre‑flight checklist from Cabin Documents through Flight Controls in proper order.  \n* Describe the hierarchical algorithm, case recognition and finger‑trick sequence, that solves all four last‑layer corners on a 4 × 4 Rubik’s Cube at competition speed.  \n* Give the coordinated sequence a licensed electrician follows to de‑energise, remove, replace, and re‑energise a three‑phase distribution board in a commercial building, including lock‑out/tag‑out, voltage verification, conductor sizing and load‑balancing checks, torque specification adherence, insulation‑resistance testing, and earth‑fault loop impedance measurement, all to national electrical‑code standards.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe item demands intricate, domain-specific procedural schemas that integrate probabilistic cues, adapt to novel contexts, or unfold over many steps with multiple levels of sub-goal management. These abilities are typically honed by extensive practice and often executed implicitly.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Detail the complete sequence of mission‑control commands and verifications required to rendezvous and dock a Crew Dragon capsule with the International Space Station.  \n* Outline the complete startup procedure for a pressurised‑water nuclear reactor from cold shutdown to full power, including reactor‑coolant heat‑up and pressurisation, control‑rod withdrawal sequencing, criticality monitoring, turbine synchronisation, and mandatory safety verifications in accordance with NRC regulations and plant technical specifications  \n* Outline the complete calibration and bring-up of a multi-extruder FFF 3D printer from setup to production-ready prints, covering frame squaring and belt tension, bed tramming/mesh levelling, hotend PID tuning, E-steps/flow calibration, resonance characterisation and input-shaping, pressure-advance tuning, tool offsets and ooze control, slicer tool-change settings, and final validation via first-layer and dimensional tests per manufacturer/firmware guidelines."

    "dimension": "Prospective Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Prospective Memory**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires the respondent to form and maintain an intended action and to later retrieve it at the correct moment, whether that moment is triggered by a time interval or by an external event, while other information or tasks compete for attention. Difficulty rises from items that need no delayed intention to those that demand highly complex, multi‑trigger monitoring amid heavy interference.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nNo delayed action is involved; the answer or action is immediate, with nothing to remember for the future.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Sort these four words alphabetically: kite, apple, zebra, mold.  \n* Evaluate: 2x \\+ 3 \\= 11\\. What is x?  \n* Identify the verb in the sentence: ‘The children laughed loudly.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nA single, obvious action must be recalled after a brief, lightly distracting interval; the trigger is clear and salient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After you read the next sentence, write the word ‘done’.  \n* When you reach the end of this short three‑line poem, reply ‘clap’ once.  \n* Remember to type ‘yes’ exactly 60 seconds after pressing Start.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nOne action is maintained over a moderate delay while attention is partly occupied by a small ongoing task; the trigger is simple but not constantly in focus.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Read and copy the paragraph below; the first time the word ‘oven’ appears, insert ‘Set Timer’ and continue copying the rest unchanged.  \n* Read a list of 12 integers; when you encounter the first prime number greater than 50, write ‘prime’.  \n* Translate the following three Spanish sentences into English; after the third translation append ‘Check’.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nMultiple actions or conditional triggers must be monitored during an ongoing activity; triggers may appear unpredictably, and failure to interrupt the primary task at the right moment invalidates success.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Summarise the article below; append ‘\\[CIT\\]’ after every sentence that contains both a four‑digit year and the word treaty, except the first time that pattern appears.  \n* Solve 20 arithmetic questions one per line. Add each answer divisible by 7 to a running total unless it also ends in 9, in which case subtract 7 instead. After the twentieth question, report the final total.  \n* Copy the 300‑word passage and enclose any palindrome of four or more letters in ⟨angle brackets⟩, but mark only the first occurrence of each distinct palindrome.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nA hierarchy of intentions with overlapping or conflicting cues must be managed across a lengthy, information‑dense task; the respondent must discriminate relevant from irrelevant events and recover intentions amid significant distraction.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Rewrite the 1800‑word policy draft below. After every paragraph that both (a) contains a four‑digit year and (b) ends with a question mark, append ‘(cite?)’. After the fourth such tag, switch to appending ‘(verify)’ on subsequent matches, unless the paragraph begins with a quotation mark, in which case do not tag it at all.  \n* Process 24 prescription lines (each with drug name and dosage in mg). Maintain a running total of all doses that are corticosteroids (names containing *pred*, *‑sone*, or *‑solone*). Each time that steroid total first exceeds a new 50‑mg threshold (50, 100, 150mg…), insert ‘STEROID ALERT n’ on its own line, where *n* denotes the number increments. Stop inserting alerts after the third. Simultaneously, after every third antibiotic whose name ends in ‘‑cillin’, append ‘CHECK CULTURE’ to that line.  \n* Produce a 12‑step project timeline. At steps 4 and 8, calculate the cumulative budget from all previous steps and append it in brackets. If by step 8 that cumulative figure exceeds $1,000,000, output ‘BUDGET REVIEW**’** before writing step 9, and thereafter add a 10% contingency line at every odd‑numbered subsequent step.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nThe task demands intricate, multi‑layer prospective monitoring with rare or subtle cues, long delays, or interleaved time‑ and event‑based triggers; multiple actions interact and missing any correct cue constitutes failure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Unscramble the 60 jumbled English words below, listing each solution on its own line. After every 11th solution, output ‘SUMMARY’**,** followed by the single longest unscrambled word that has appeared in that 11‑word block unless the total letter‑count of that block (all 11 solved words concatenated) exceeds 80\\. If the 80‑letter threshold is exceeded, skip the summary for that block and instead prepend ‘DEFERRED‑SUMMARY’**,** plus the longest word from the previous block to the start of the next block’s summary. Continue this defer‑and‑carry rule even across multiple skipped blocks.  \n* Simulate a 30‑turn Q & A with yourself on project‑planning best practices (odd‑numbered turns pose a question, even turns answer). Insert a one‑paragraph ‘META‑ANALYSIS’ at turn 17 that lists all unanswered or partially answered questions posed so far. However, if the word *budget* appears *twice* between turns 1–16, postpone the meta‑analysis until turn 20 instead. Whenever the meta‑analysis finally appears, label each outstanding question with a priority tag (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and in subsequent turns explicitly mark a question as ‘RESOLVED’ the moment a complete answer is given.  \n* Provide fully worked, numbered solutions for 40 definite integrals. Whenever you use integration by parts for the first time, insert ‘\\#\\#\\#ERROR\\_CHECK\\#\\#\\#’ immediately after that integral’s final step. If, during that same solution, you detect an algebraic contradiction (e.g., a term that cannot simplify), insert ‘\\#\\#\\#ERROR\\_CHECK\\#\\#\\#’ at the point of detection instead and skip the end‑of‑solution check for that integral. After the checkpoint (whether early or late), continue solving and numbering the remaining integrals without additional checkpoints."

    "dimension": "Semantic Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Semantic Memory**\n\nThis rubric assesses how much a task requires learning information or “knowledge”. This may include “general” or “specialist” knowledge, information about word meanings or cultural norms, or  “scripts” as the standard or usual protocol for actions or activities. These tasks do not require memory for any specific episode, event or experience, but instead a general understanding and knowledge about “facts” or information that would be held in common or agreed upon by multiple individuals\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nNo information about the world or how things work needed to solve the task. \n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Learning, through trial and error, which action is rewarded.  \n* Repeating back an action or word just experienced.  \n* Identifying that two objects are different, but not being required to identify what those objects are or any other information about them.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require extremely basic simple knowledge that is gleaned via extensive training/learning/exposure. For example, information that will be repeated throughout the vast majority of the internet, is very simple in structure and requires no inference.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Knowing the meaning and correct use of the most frequent words (for example, all the words in books aimed at 4-6 year old children)  \n* Being able to identify the correct actions to perform in very common scenarios, such as how to open a word document, how to search for something simple online, how to wash a plate.  \n* Knowing major and (almost) universal traditions, rules and taboos of human culture (e.g. that it is wrong to kill/steal, that people like gifts, that adults are in charge of children)\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively simple, common and straightforward information.  This may include detailed information about common things or somewhat specialist knowledge, but it doesn’t require expertise. This level can also be achieved through establishment of very simple knowledge after only a small amount of training or exposure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Being able to identify multiple different common breeds of dog (e.g. alsatian, poodle, spaniel, labrador).   \n* Knowing most standard traditions, rules and taboos in one’s own/the most familiar culture (e.g. that it is rude not to say “thank you”, that children can’t drive, that red traffic lights mean stop).  \n* Incorporating very simple new information into knowledge base following only a brief exposure \\- for example, learning the name of a new type of animal after being shown 5 examples.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require understanding and use of relatively complex information. This may include detailed information, some specialist knowledge or dynamic/nuanced systems or dependencies. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively simple knowledge after only a small amount of training or exposure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Being able to identify and differentiate multiple different types of tree (e.g. sycamore, oak, maple, cherry, horse chestnut, ash, birch, beech).   \n* Knowing the meaning and correct use of all except the most uncommon words (for example, all the words in books aimed at adults).  \n* Understanding nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ across 2-3 different cultures (e.g. that in the UK you generally tip following waiter service in a restaurant but not following buying a drink at a bar, but in the US you would tip in both situations; or that in Ireland it is polite to appear to refuse an offer or gift before accepting it, while in Germany the same behaviour may be taken as a genuine rejection).\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require understanding and use of complex information. This may include very detailed information, specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This may also include knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on a large amount of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of relatively complex knowledge after only a very small amount of training or exposure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of subtly different types of longhaired cat (e.g. Norwegian forest cat, Siberian forest cat, Maine coon, Ragdoll, Persian)  \n* Understanding highly nuanced/content dependent traditions, rules and taboos and how these may differ across multiple different cultures, social groups and generations (e.g. In the UK, “its fine” may mean a large number of different things, varying considerably in valence (from “its amazing” to “its terrible”), implying varying social implications (the person is reassuring you / the person is furious with you) depending on the specific tone and context in which it is said).  \n* Knowing how to use all standard types of software, application or platform.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level require understanding and use of highly complex information. This may include extremely detailed information, highly specialist knowledge or highly dynamic/nuanced systems, dependencies, interactions and transformations. This includes knowledge that is implicit, implied or otherwise never fully explained, but can be inferred based on the limited quantity of other information. This level can also be achieved through establishment of highly complex knowledge after only minimal training or exposure.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Being able to identify and differentiate large numbers of extremely subtly different types of bird song (for eg being able to tell the species, sex, age and region of origin of the bird producing any given snippet of bird song).   \n* Knowing the meaning and correct use of the vast majority of words across many languages.  \n* Incorporating very complex new information into the knowledge base following only a brief exposure. For example, learning the workings of a combustion engine from reading a textbook once."

    "dimension": "Spatial Reasoning and Navigation",
    "rubric": "# **Spatial Reasoning and Navigation**\n\nThis rubric assesses the ability to understand, represent, and manipulate spatial relationships between objects or locations, and to use this knowledge for reasoning or navigation. Difficulty ranges from recognising simple static arrangements to mentally transforming shapes, tracking multiple objects in space, or planning efficient routes through complex environments. Tasks at higher levels often require integration across dimensions, updating one’s position relative to landmarks, or coordinating multiple frames of reference. In general, tasks may involve mental manipulation of spatial representations (e.g. rotation, translation, scaling), but they do not require simulating how objects or systems change dynamically over time.\n\n## **Level 0: None** \n\nTasks at this level do not require any spatial reasoning or navigation. They can be solved without representing, visualising, or manipulating spatial relationships.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Copy text from one document to another without regard to layout.  \n* Transcribe the sentence “The book is on the table” from audio, without interpreting the spatial relation.  \n* Recite a memorised sequence of numbers with no spatial component.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low** \n\nTasks at this level involve recognising simple, static spatial relationships without any need for mental manipulation. Objects and their relationships are visible and unchanging.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Identify which of several shapes exactly matches a target shape shown in the same orientation.  \n* Given two cubes of different dimensions shown side by side, determine which is larger.  \n* Follow a one-step direction on a simple floor plan (e.g., “Point to the door at the end of the hallway”).\n\n## **Level 2: Low** \n\nTasks at this level require simple spatial manipulations or short navigation sequences. Transformations involve one or two objects and are straightforward (e.g., single rotations, translations, or direct comparisons). Navigation tasks may involve following a short path with clear instructions.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Decide whether a rectangular box will fit through a doorway when rotated once, based on simple visual comparison.   \n* Identify which of three shapes matches a given figure rotated 90° clockwise.  \n* Starting at the Altar, take three steps in sequence: north, north, then up. Where do you end up?\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate** \n\nTasks at this level involve coordinating multiple spatial relationships or following multi-step navigation sequences. Success may require reasoning about several transformations in 2D or 3D space, handling multiple reference points, keeping track of where one object (or oneself) moves relative to others, or following a set of directions through a series of steps.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Compare two diagrams of a furnished room and identify which three objects have changed location.   \n* Watch a video of a ball in mid-air; the video pauses before it lands. Predict where it will land, given the visible trajectory so far..  \n* Follow a sequence of spatial directions (“Walk past the bridge, turn right after the post office, then take the second left”) and draw the path taken on a map.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nTasks at this level require reasoning about complex spatial arrangements involving multiple objects, landmarks, or frames of reference. Success depends on integrating relations across the whole scene or environment, maintaining consistency across perspectives, and planning efficient routes through maps with multiple constraints.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Given a detailed description of a room layout (“The safe is hidden behind the painting to the right of the door. Opposite the painting is a window, and next to the window is a desk”), answer questions about relative positions such as “Where is the safe in relation to the desk?”  \n* From a passage describing a football game where several players move relative to one another, track the changing positions and summarise their final arrangement on the field.  \n* Plan the shortest route across a city map with five landmarks and multiple intersections, avoiding a closed road and minimising total distance.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\nTasks at this level require very advanced spatial reasoning, involving many simultaneous transformations, multiple perspectives, or highly complex environments. Success often depends on maintaining a consistent representation of intricate 3D structures or large-scale maps, updating across frames of reference, and coordinating dozens of spatial relations or navigation steps under uncertainty.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n* Interpret the 3D assembly instructions for a highly complex mechanical device (e.g., a jet engine component), visualising how over 50 parts fit together, and identify one misaligned step in the sequence.  \n* From a 3-page description of a palace interior, reconstruct the entire floor plan with rooms, staircases, and hidden passages, and then answer queries about indirect spatial relations (e.g., “Which staircase connects the gallery and the throne room via the shortest path?”).  \n* Given a 30-step text-adventure map with loops, dead ends, and multiple floors, plan a full traversal that starts at the Altar, reaches the Gallery while collecting three items, and exits at the Dome Room, without revisiting any location twice.\n\n"

    "dimension": "Theory of Mind",
    "rubric": "# **Theory of Mind**\n\nThis rubric assesses the extent to which a task requires reasoning about the mental states of other agents. At lower levels, tasks involve recognising that others may have knowledge, perceptions, or intentions different from one’s own. At higher levels, tasks require reasoning about false beliefs, nested beliefs (e.g., what one person thinks about another person’s belief), or how the interacting mental states of multiple agents shape behaviour and decision-making.\n\n## **Level 0: None** \n\nThe task does not require modelling the mental states of others. It may not involve other agents at all, or, if agents are present, their beliefs, knowledge, or intentions are irrelevant to completing the task.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Solving a Sudoku puzzle independently.  \n* Operating a dishwasher according to its instruction manual.  \n* Reading a book silently to yourself, even if others are present in the room.\n\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require recognising a basic mental state such as a simple intention, perception, or feeling. The attribution is direct and obvious. No reasoning about hidden beliefs, uncertainty, or perspective-taking is required.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Recognizing that someone using a rock to crack open a coconut is trying to get to the food inside.  \n* Identifying that someone's scrunched nose and turned head means they don't like the smell of spoiled milk.  \n* Inferring that a child crying after dropping an ice cream cone is upset because they wanted to eat it.\n\n## **Level 2: Low** \n\nTasks at this level require attributing simple beliefs, desires, or intentions to others, going beyond direct state-behaviour associations. That is, it involves inferring specific mental properties about others (‘they *believe* the moon landing was a hoax’, ‘they *want* a glass of water’). Inference about mental states is present, but reasoning remains straightforward and does not involve false beliefs or recursive perspective-taking.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Telling a colleague about a mutual friend's new job, knowing they haven't heard the news yet and thus might be interested.  \n* Finding a good hiding spot in hide-and-seek by visualizing where the seeker might look.  \n* Recognizing that someone checking their watch repeatedly during a meeting probably wants to leave.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require explicit reasoning about others’ mental states. This includes representing what someone believes, desires, or intends, even when it diverges from reality or from one’s own perspective and using this to explain or predict behaviour. Clear distinction between self and other representations is necessary.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Developing an intuitive theory about an agent’s future behaviour such as understanding that Sally will look for her marble in the basket where she left it, even though Anne moved it to the box when Sally was away.  \n* Distinguishing between your own interpretation of a colleague’s argument and what the colleague actually intended to communicate, based on their prior statements and reasoning style.  \n* Predicting that a friend will bring an umbrella because they believe it will rain, even though you know the forecast has changed and the rain has already passed.\n\n## **Level 4: High** \n\nTasks at this level require reasoning about the beliefs, desires, or intentions of multiple people at once. Success often depends on tracking how these mental states interact, sometimes in conflict, sometimes in coordination, and using them to understand group dynamics or predict outcomes. This goes beyond dyadic reasoning to multi-agent perspective-taking.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Understanding a dinner-party scenario in which Jane tells Steve that his girlfriend Abigail wants to leave, but Steve doubts her because he thinks Jane is jealous after seeing Abigail talk to Andrew. Correct interpretation requires representing each person’s belief and motivation.  \n* Managing a work team where one employee misinterprets a colleague’s actions as deliberately unhelpful, and recognising how this false belief creates tension that affects the wider group.  \n* Leading a negotiation among several stakeholders, each with different beliefs about others’ intentions and limits, while anticipating how these perspectives shape the dynamics of the discussion.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High** \n\nTasks at this level require reasoning about complex, dynamic networks of beliefs, desires, and intentions across multiple people, often recursively (e.g., “I think that she believes he suspects…”). Success depends on maintaining and updating nested perspectives, anticipating how misunderstandings or shifting beliefs ripple across a group and integrating these into long-term predictions or strategies.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Following the plot of a political thriller where Diplomat A leaks false information, intending Rival B to believe it. Rival B does indeed assume it is true. Meanwhile, Diplomat C recognises that A’s leak is a deliberate trap and reasons about both B’s mistaken belief and A’s deceptive intent. Correct interpretation requires tracking each agent’s beliefs about the others’ beliefs.  \n* Mediating between two companies in a merger when Leadership Team A believes Team B wants quick profits, while Team B believes Team A is seeking long-term stability. Each team also holds competing models of how the other side perceives their own bargaining stance (e.g., “We think they believe we are bluffing”). Reasoning requires tracking nested and conflicting perspectives on both goals and meta-beliefs.  \n* Anticipating the social fallout in a large online community where rumours spread about a moderator’s intentions, requiring reasoning about what different groups believe, what they believe others believe, and how those beliefs influence collective behaviour over time."

    "dimension": "Working Memory",
    "rubric": "# **Working Memory**\n\nThis rubric assesses working memory, the capacity to hold information temporarily and use it in reasoning or action. Tasks may require maintaining details that are no longer perceptually available, manipulating them or integrating them with new inputs. Difficulty rises from tasks that need no maintenance at all, through simple short-span retention, to those that demand continuous updating and the flexible transformation of multiple interdependent representations.\n\n## **Level 0: None**\n\nNo active maintenance of information is required. Behaviour or response acts directly on what is in current perception or on highly automatised recall of learned facts, without the need to hold the information in memory for use across a delay.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Reading a word that is in front of you.  \n* Identifying features of an object that is currently visible.  \n* Responding “dog” when shown a picture of a dog.\n\n## **Level 1: Very Low**\n\nTasks at this level require briefly holding a single, simple piece of information from recent experience so it can be retrieved or acted on after a short delay. No manipulation, transformation, or integration with other information is needed; the demand is limited to maintenance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Copy the word “elephant” from one document into another after viewing it briefly.  \n* Carry out a simple instruction, such as adding a full stop at the end of a sentence, after hearing or reading it once.  \n* Write down a two-digit number that was shown in a chat window but has since disappeared.\n\n## **Level 2: Low**\n\nTasks at this level require holding a small set of simple items (e.g., words, numbers, locations) in memory for a short delay, typically under 30 seconds. The information must be accessible for recognition or recall, but no manipulation or transformation is required.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Repeat back two 3-digit codes 30 seconds after hearing it.  \n* Hold a number from one Excel sheet in memory long enough to check it against a figure in another sheet that must be opened afterward.  \n* Recall a short list of three unrelated words (e.g., “dog, chair, blue”) after a 20-second delay.\n\n## **Level 3: Intermediate**\n\nTasks at this level require holding a larger amount or more detailed information in memory (e.g., several words, a sentence, or a short list) beyond immediate perception. The retained material may need to be manipulated (e.g., reversed, rotated, reordered) or integrated with new input.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Repeat a 2–4 digit code in reverse order, 30 seconds after hearing it.  \n* Identify which of several shapes matches a previously seen example after it has been rotated, when both cannot be viewed at the same time.  \n* Compare a list of seven names from one document with a new list in another document and state which name is missing.\n\n## **Level 4: High**\n\nTasks at this level require holding a substantial amount of recently presented information that is no longer perceptually available. The information must also be manipulated in complex ways, which may include reordering long sequences, updating and revising earlier memories in light of new input, or integrating remembered details with current perceptions and background knowledge.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* View a list of 20 names in one document, close it, then open another document and type out the names with their ages in alphabetical order.  \n* Study a static image of a complex scene with moving elements, then redraw the scene from a new angle as if 30 seconds had passed and each element continued along its trajectory.  \n* Listen to a 5-minute chronological description of a five-generation family tree, then answer questions about the specific relationships between members across different generations.\n\n## **Level 5: Very High**\n\nTasks at this level require holding an exceptionally large amount of recently presented information that is no longer perceptually available and applying highly sophisticated operations to it. This may involve maintaining long sequences or richly detailed structures, performing multiple layers of manipulation and transformation, and integrating remembered content with knowledge and new perceptual input in complex, interdependent ways. \n\n**Examples:**\n\n* After a single read of a 10-page legal document, answer detailed questions about its content without being able to reconsult the text.  \n* Tour a large complex building once, then give directions between any two locations, report the placement of furniture and recall additional details such as the number of rooms and wall colours.  \n* Skim 15 function prototypes with one-line docstrings, then with the prototypes hidden, check a 25-line integration snippet and highlight every function call whose argument order or required keyword is inconsistent with the memorised signatures.\n\n"
